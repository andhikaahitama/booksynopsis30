<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Emmanuel Levinas: The Problem of Ethical Metaphysics (Perspectives in Continental Philosophy)</h2><p>Edith Wyschogrod presents the first full-length study in English of the important contemporary French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas. It is a revision of the author&#x2019;s earlier study and includes discussions of his recent writings as well as current scholarship. Dr. Wyschogrod&#x2019;s extensive discussion of Levinas's relation to Judaism, especially his use of literature from the Torah and other religious writings, will be of interest to religious scholars. The author compares Levinas&#x2019;s thought with that of his contemporaries, most notably Jacques Derrida and Husserl.</p><p>Edith Wyschogrod is J. Newton Rayzor Professor of Philosophy and Religious Thought emerita at Rice University. The most recent of her books are An Ethics of Remembering: History, Heterology, and the Nameless Others; Saints and Postmodernism: Revisioning Moral Philosophy; and a second edition of Emmanuel Levinas: The Problem of Ethical Metaphysics (Fordham).&#x201c;Wyschogrod focuses upon the unique and innovative aspects of Levinas, [his] attempts to base metaphysics on ethics rather than the traditional subordination of ethical theories to preconceived metaphysics.&#x201d; (<i>&#x2015;The Modern Schoolman</i>)</p><h2>Reluctant Disciplinarian: Advice on Classroom Management From a Softy who Became (Eventually) a Successful Teacher</h2><p>In this funny and insightful book, Gary Rubinstein relives his own truly disastrous first year of teaching. He begins his teaching career armed only with idealism and romantic visions of teaching - and absolutely no classroom management skills. By his fourth year, however, he is named his school&#39;s &#34;Teacher of the Year.&#34; As Rubinstein details his transformation from incompetent to successful teacher, he shows what works and what doesn&#39;t work when managing a classroom.</p><p>Rubinstein currently works at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. He has been a teacher trainer for Teach For America and The New York City Teaching Fellows. Rubinstein&#39;s essays and articles about teaching have appeared in national magazines and journals, including Education Week, Teacher Magazine and Mathematics Teacher.</p><h2>Uncommon Graces: Christlike Responses to a Hostile World</h2><p>BRING HOPE TO A HOSTILE WORLD. <p>The world we live in today is hostile. From road rage to unkind words, our society suffers from a lack of grace. It doesn't have to be that way, writes John Vawter. Uncommon Graces examines character traits and attitudes that bring dignity to human relationships, injecting grace into the dehumanized society in which we find ourselves. If you want to treat people with kindness and dignity, Uncommon Graces will encourage and equip you to show grace to a hostile world. </p><p>"There are only a few authors who have the skill to recount their experiences in a way that allows the reader to join the adventure and not just be a bystander. Like Gordon MacDonald and Philip Yancey, John Vawter takes what is common to us all and turns it into an uncommon gift of insight and wisdom."-Fred Smith, Jr., president, The Fourth Partner Foundation </p><p>"In his excellent book, John Vawter reminds believers of our biblical heritage-a standard of commitment to Christ and the Holy Spirit, which if practiced could result in a mighty spiritual harvest for the glory of God."-Dr. Bill Bright, founder and president, Campus Crusade for Christ International </p><p>"John Vawter personifies grace for the countless people like me whose lives he has touched. As a member of Congress in a hostile arena during a hostile era, I find Uncommon Graces comes at an opportune time and probes a fundamental aspect of Christianity often overlooked."-Jim Ramstad, congressman, 3rd district, Minnesota</p></p><p>JOHN VAWTER is a senior pastor serving at Bethany Community Church in Arizona and was also the president of Phoenix Seminary for several years. He has worked with Campus Crusade for Christ and has taught at numerous seminaries across the country. He earned his doctor of ministry degree from Bethel Seminary and his master&#39;s of divinity from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. A frequent speaker, Dr. Vawter&#39;s passion is to help others relate the Bible to their everyday lives. He lives with his wife in Scottsdale, Arizona.Vawter, pastor of Bethany Community Church (Tempe, Ariz.), claims that we live in a graceless world. He divides his book into two parts. In part one, he discusses the uncommon graces he believes today's world needs: gentleness, attentiveness, loyalty, candor, mercy, kindness and repentance. Vawter uses personal anecdotes and examples from Scripture to illustrate the power of these uncommon graces. For instance, he describes how his father, whose speech and motor skills had been severely affected by a brain tumor, reached out in a simple gesture of loyalty to a longtime community friend. In part two, he asserts that we can nurture uncommon graces by building community and living according to the Golden Rule. Vawter believes that the hostility and violence he sees characterizing our world can be changed simply by enacting the virtues of respect and graciousness. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Holt Biology: Student Edition 2004</h2><p>2004 Biology book, hardcover, student edition</p><p></p><h2>Heretic's Heart: A Journey Through Spirit &amp; Revolution</h2><p>A refreshing, personal look back at the 1960s and their impact on American history and culture offers a portrait of a free speech advocate at Berkeley during the sixties, a woman who helped register black voters, and an anti-war activist who began a friendship with a soldier in Vietnam.</p><p>Adler was a young woman determined to be taken seriously and to be an agent of change - on her own terms, free from dogma and authoritarian constraints. From campus activism at the University of California at Berkeley to civil-rights work in Mississippi, from antiwar protests to observing the socialist revolution in Cuba, she found those chances in the 1960s. Heretic&#39;s Heart illuminates the events, ideas, passions, and ecstatic commitments of the decade like no other memoir. At the book&#39;s center is the powerful - and unique - correspondence between Adler, then an antiwar activist at Berkeley, and a young American soldier fighting in Vietnam. The correspondence begins when Adler reads a letter the infantryman has written to a Berkeley newspaper. &#34;I&#39;ve heard rumors that there are people back in the world who don&#39;t believe this war should be. I&#39;m not positive of this though, &#39;cause it seems to me that if enough of them told the right people in the right way, then something might be done about it....You see, while you&#39;re discussing it amongst each other, being beat, getting in bed with dark-haired artists...some people here are dying for lighting a cigarette at night&#34;. Heretic&#39;s Heart also explores Adler&#39;s attempt to come to terms with her singular legacy as the &#39;only grandchild of Alfred Adler, collaborator of Freud and founder of Individual Psychology, and as the daughter of a forceful beauty who bequeaths her spunk and adventurousness to her daughter, but whose overpowering personality forces Adler to strike out on her own. Adler&#39;s memoir marks an initiatory journey from spirit through politics and revolution back to spirit again.Margot Adler is the New York bureau chief for National Public Radio and author of <i>Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today</i>.

There are hundreds of different plants growing wild throughout the United States that over the centuries have become recognized for their medicinal qualities. Charles F. Millspaugh's <i>American Medicinal Plants </i>was one of the first works to catalogue these many plants and to present thorough exacting descriptions of them as well as their uses and properties to the layman. <br>After general descriptions of the order and genus, every plant is presented in botanical sequence. Common and scientific names are given along with the name of the botanist who classified it. Then follows a detailed description of the plant with full information on its size, color, shape, range, habitat, and other distinguishing characteristics. The uses of the plant for medicinal purposes are equally detailed, citing observations from the time of the Greeks up to the near present. Each&nbsp;disease or ailment it is reported to have an effect upon is noted, as well as are the plant's adverse or toxic effects. Methods of preparation are dutifully given along with the chemical constituents extracted from the plant. Altogether 180 individual plants are covered &#x2014; each with a full page illustration; but considering the generic descriptions given at the beginning of each section, over 1,000 valuable species are touched upon. <br>Although many of the remedies in this book are now considered questionable, many of them may still be useful. The thorough descriptions and true-to-life drawings will greatly aid you in locating and identifying the plants, and you can use the recipes that are given for their preparation. A special feature is the therapeutic index, which keys over 1,000 ailments to alleged botanicals. Anyone who is interested in and uses natural herbs and plants will find this the best book available on their therapeutic aspects.</p><p></p><h2>War and Peace (Translated by Louise and Aylmer Maude)</h2><p><p>Considered one of the greatest novels ever written, "War and Peace" masterfully captures an intimate view of humanity on an epic scale. In this sweeping narrative, Tolstoy utilizes a large cast of characters to brilliantly depict the impact of war on society. Set during the Napoleonic Wars, the novel centers its story on five aristocratic Russian families. These characters, particularly Count Pyotr Kirillovich (Pierre) Bezukhov, Prince Andrey Nikolayevich Bolkonsky, and Countess Natalya Ilyinichna (Natasha) Rostova, demonstrate different human struggles that are affected by their history, present era, and culture. They simultaneously develop the concepts on which Tolstoy expounds in the thematic essays interspersed throughout the narrative. "War and Peace" is a work so groundbreaking that it was not even considered a novel when first published in 1865. In redefining the fictional genre, Tolstoy's genius has explored the human condition with a sensibility that is reflective of the nature and spirit of Russia itself. This edition follows the translation of Louise and Aylmer Maude and is printed on premium acid-free paper.</p></p><p>Among the great novels of the world, &#39;War and Peace&#39; has long held pride of place because it fulfills, in its seamless interweaving of the historical and the personal, and its genius in registering the entire scale of human life, all the promise latent in the art of fiction itself.Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910), a giant of world literature, is the author of many classics, including War and Peace and Anna Karenina.<br><br>George Gibian was Goldwin Smith Professor of Russian and Comparative Literature at Cornell University.

These include redistribution, the right to exclude, regulatory takings, eminent domain, and intellectual property. The book highlights the Aristotelian human flourishing theory of property, providing the most comprehensive and accessible introduction to that theory to date. The book&#39;s goal is neither to cover every conceivable theory nor to discuss every possible facet of the theories covered. Instead, it aims to make the major property theories comprehensible to beginners, without sacrificing accuracy or sophistication. The book will be of particular interest to students seeking an accessible introduction to contemporary theories of property, but even specialists will benefit from the book&#39;s lucid descriptions of contemporary debates.</p><p>This book surveys the leading modern theories of property and then applies those theories to concrete contexts in which property issues have been especially controversial.

These materials gently develop concepts, and the practice of those concepts is extended over a considerable period of time. This is called "incremental development and continual review." Material is introduced in easily understandable pieces (increments), allowing students to grasp one facet of a concept before the next one is introduced. Both facets are then practiced together until another one is introduced. This feature is combined with continual review in every lesson throughout the year. Topics are never dropped but are increased in complexity and practiced every day, providing the time required for concepts to become totally familiar. Saxon Math 5/4 is an integrated mathematics program that consists of 120 daily lessons and 12 activity-based Investigations. Students are tested after every fifth lesson, and all tests are cumulative. Concepts are introduced incrementally and are continually practiced throughout the problem sets. This home study kit contains a student textbook, a solutions manual, and tests &amp; worksheets.

With an early career as a satirist and parodist, Thackeray shared a fondness for roguish characters that is evident in his early works such as Vanity Fair, The Luck of Barry Lyndon, and Catherine, and was ranked second only to Charles Dickens during the height of his career. In his later work, Thackeray transitioned from the satirical tone for which he was known to a more traditional Victorian narrative, the most notable of which is The History of Henry Esmond. Thackeray died in 1863.</p></p><h2>Remembering the Future: The New York World&#39;s Fair from 1939 to 1964</h2><p>Essays on two world fairs summarize their history, social, and cultural impact</p><p>This book is the accompaniment to an exhibit at The Queens Museum celebrating the 50th and 25th anniversaries of the two New York world's fairs. It consists of seven solid, scholarly essays, each offering interesting comparisons of the two fairs' visions of the future; the science and technology at each; their architecture; their art displays; their images and icons; and last but not least, the role of Robert Moses in each of them. One essayist observes, "If 1939 was the promise, 1964 was the fulfillment--but a fulfillment already crumbling . . . by 1964 the future had already happened, the postwar boom was running out of gas." The 1964 fair was the end of an era that gave way to perpetual world's fairs, expensive theme parks. Recommended for public and academic libraries.<br><i>- Jeffrey R.

Hilarious Hebrew is for anyone interested in learning new Hebrew words and the method used works wonderfully for ANYBODY, whether they consider themselves good at learning a foreign language or not. All you need to do is... read the carefully constructed sentences, enjoy the illustrations or simply imagine the situations described in the sentences - you will be amazed at your ability to remember the new words! This is how it works: Each new word is taught in the context of a sentence, written in English, that teaches the pronunciation of the word in Hebrew as well as its meaning through the contents of the sentence. For example, as the Hebrew word for 'house' is 'buyit', our sentence is: 'what a lovely HOUSE! I think I'm going to BUY IT'. Or, as the Hebrew for 'cold' is 'kar', our sentence reads -'it's COLD in my CAR'</p></p><p><b>YAEL BREUER</b> is from Rehovot, Israel and lives in Brighton. She teaches Modern Hebrew and also writes for the Jewish Chronicle. Her articles about British culture and lifestyle appeared in the Israeli newspapers Ha'aretz and Ma'ariv. <p> <b>EYAL SHAVIT</b> is from Kibbutz Kfar Szold in Northern Israel. He is a musician based in Brighton, England.</p>The book cleverly uses sentences in English, with recognizable illustrations, to introduce Hebrew words. The humour is quite rightly hilarious and the Hebrew is memorable, making Hilarious Hebrew a must-have learning companion. And if you re not learning, this book is a great place to start. In the case of Hilarious Hebrew, you really should judge a book by its cover. --<b>Jewish News UK</b><br><br>The book essentially teaches Hebrew words in an entertaining and original way, through sentences written in English and accompanying illustrations. <b>--Mike Cohen, Jewish Tribune Canada</b> <p> Breuer and Shavit's methodology is geared toward people who learn best through narrative and visual cues.<b>--Renee Ghert-Zand, Times of Israel</b> </p><p> Even the most ardent supporters of Israel might wish at times that its inhabitants had chosen an easier language ...two Israeli expats have come up with the idea of applying English phrases as memory cues to make Hebrew words stick in their minds. The result is a slim, richly illustrated and frequently funny pocket book by Yael Breuer and Eyal Shavit titled Hilarious Hebrew and billed as the fun and fast way to learn the language. </p><p> For instance, a cartoon shows a mountain climber and his unhappy dog getting soaked in the rain, with the man exclaiming, OH, HELL. We forgot the TENT. Below is the linguistic link: The Hebrew word for 'TENT' is ... OHEL. The final word is spelled out in both English and Hebrew letters. </p><p> The first to test the efficacy of the authors' teaching method was Smith, a gentile Brit, who absorbed many Hebrew words while doing the illustrations for the book. </p><p> Breuer said she is perhaps proudest of the comment from a student she had tutored 22 years earlier and had recently met again.

Why did Saatchi and Saatchi&#39;s global strategy bring the company to its knees? Why has Philips&#39;s outstanding record in innovation not been translated into success in the market? What can be learnt from the marriage contract about the conduct of commercial negotiations? These are some of the questions addressed as John Kay asks &#39;What makes a business successful? &#39; Drawing on his own business experience and on concepts in economics, legal theory, and sociology, the author presents a fresh approach to questions of business strategy. He rejects the military analogy which underpins much strategic thinking, in which success depends on size and share, on vision and leadership, on shifting patterns of mergers and alliances. John Kay argues that outstanding businesses derive their strength from a distinctive structure of relationships with employees, customers, and suppliers, and explains why continuity and stability in these relationships is essential for a flexible and co-operative response to change. By integrating organizational and financial perspectives on the performance of the firm, Kay not only gives insights into the creation of effective business strategies, but sheds light on the success - and failure - of national economies. As the single market develops, this book - full of insight and rigour, yet lively in style - is probably the most important European contribution to strategic thinking for many years.

Through mindfulness meditation, an ancient Buddhist practice, Anna Black shows you how to intentionally pay attention to your daily experience. When we are not being mindful, we miss out on small moments that often are the most valuable&#x2014;be it a beautiful building that we pass on our journey to work, the taste and texture of lovingly prepared food, or the fact that we are needed by those we love the most. By being &#x201c;mindless&#x201d; we miss opportunities for personal growth by not being aware of our shortcomings or our inner strength, or by letting negative thoughts and emotions control us. In mindfulness meditation we pay attention to our ongoing experience whether it is pleasant&#x2014;such as appreciating a starry night sky; unpleasant&#x2014;a disagreement with a loved one; or neutral&#x2014;doing chores. We become aware of our habitual thoughts and behaviors and discover which are helpful and which are not. We learn to listen to the body and pick up warning signs of stress as well as tune in to our inner wisdom.</p><p><p>Through simple mindfulness meditation, learn to live in the moment and enjoy a life that is more vivid, awake, connected, and true.</p>Anna Black began practicing mindfulness as a way of managing her own stress.

Each poem is accompanied by a jaunty, mischievous line drawing by Wilbur. One verse explains how to address a letter to a duck or a drake; another reveals why Missouri, home of skeptical, doubting folk, is the opposite of California, the starry-eyed residents of which "think, I'm told, that every river's full of gold." The ambivalent opposite of baby, as one illustration shows, is a balding grown-up with thumb in mouth--making the point that adults are not so different from children after all. Many of the verses try one's patience with their arch, self-conscious humor; others have the gimlet wit and subtle wordplay of Wilbur's finest translations ("The best thing's to avoid excess. Try to be moderate, more or less"). <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 3-6-- A sequel to Opposites (HBJ, 1973), featuring 34 more poems that explore words that, with the right outlook, might be considered opposites. There is inspired nonsense (``Ships would think it sappy/ To send us word that they are happy./ If you hear nothing from a liner,/ It means that things could not be finer.''), clever wordplay, and unforced humor in the tradition of Edward Lear. Each entry is accompanied by black-and-white pen drawings that extend the comedy. A book that's more than worth its weight in thoughtful amusement. --Kathleen Whalin, Belfast Public Library, ME<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Theory of Computing: A Gentle Introduction</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This book focuses on fundamental issues of computation.

Yet few of us know anything about Islam, a religion with one billion followers worldwide. Now John L. Esposito offers a timely new edition of <em>Islam: The Straight Path</em>, his widely acclaimed guide to Islamic history, faith, culture, and politics.<br> Esposito provides a succinct, up-to-date survey of the Islamic experience, an introduction to the faith, belief, and practice of Islam from its origins to the present.

Equally important, Esposito provides much needed information on contemporary Islam. This third edition has been updated throughout and is enhanced by new material that more accurately reflects the true diversity of Muslim cultures. In particular, Esposito broadens the study of Islam beyond the Middle East with a new study of Pakistan as well as a new section on the Muslim presence in the US and the impact of such figures as Malcolm X, Warith uddin Muhammad, and Louis Farrakhan. In the final chapter, Esposito discusses modern Muslim thinking on religious pluralism, democracy, and human rights. <br> With years of teaching and travel in the Islamic world, Esposito offers an informed portrait of Muslim faith and thought.

Islamic regulation and statecraft in a predominately Hindu country required strategic shifts from the original Islamic injunctions. Islamic principles could not regulate beliefs in a vast country without accepting cultural limitations and limits on the exercise of power. As a result of cultural adaptation, Islam was in the end forced to reinvent its principles for religious rule. Acculturation also forced key Islamic terms to change so fundamentally that Indian Islam could be said to have acquired a character substantially different from the Islam practiced outside of India.</p><p>This book shows the ways in which political Islam, from its establishment in medieval north India, adapted itself to a variety of indigenous contexts and became deeply Indianized.<br><br>This process, by which preexistent Arabo-Persian traditions were molded to new Indian contexts, involved changes in the manner in which Islamic rule was conceived and conducted in the subcontinent. It became gradually apparent to the conquering Muslim sultans (and Later to their successors, the Mughals), as well as to medieval thinkers and writers of treatises on Islamic morality, theology, and political doctrine, that the conduct of Islamic statecraft in a country comprising mostly Hindus entailed shifts in Islam's conceptual and institutional vocabulary. Islamic rulers could not command a vast country without accepting certain cultural limitations to the exercise of their power. In this process of acculturation, political Islam in India was forced to reinvent itself as a doctrine of rule.<br><br>From this stemmed a second change: a shift in the meanings of key Islamic terms, especially those pertaining to statehood, and in relations between rulers and subject populations. Through a close reading of a variety of texts, Muzaffar Alam shows that the vocabularies in use went through certain changes so fundamental that the language of Indian Islam became quite different from what was in vogue in contexts outside.<br><br>With its profound deployment of primary and secondary sources to study Indo-Muslim statecraft vis-�-vis Islamic theocratic languages over an eight-hundred-year stretch, this book provides major insights into the changing nature of political Islam in India.<b>Muzaffar Alam</b> is a professor in the Department of South Asian Languages and the Department of Civilization and History at the University of Chicago.

Giles's theory that all government must be legitimized by the pope was based on scriptural, philosophical, patristic, and canonical sources, and his conclusion that the pope is the rightful ruler and final judge of the world&#x2015;even in secular matters&#x2015;is the definitive statement on papal power in the Middle Ages.<br><br>This book offers a new and complete critical edition of the Latin text, based on a collation of five fourteenth-century manuscripts.

Mysteries of the Universe introduces natural oddities such as Uluru (Ayers Rock), rains of fish, and ball lightning. Man-made puzzles, including the Sphinx and Costa Rican stone spheres, join weeping religious statues and disappearing ships and planes. A few of the mysteries are explained scientifically, but most are just presented as baffling wonders. Some of the same oddities are examined in detail in Seymour Simon's Strange Mysteries from Around the World (Morrow, 1997). UFOs is equally entertaining, yet more realistic. While many photos familiar to UFO fans are part of this presentation, they are integrated with those of famous and lesser-known hoaxes. Actual photographs of ball lightning and of mysterious "spooklights" near Marfa, Texas, are among the illustrations unique to this volume. As colorful and comprehensive as Bob Rickard's UFOs (Watts, 1980; o.p.) yet less helpful for further investigation than Carole Marsh's Unidentified Flying Objects and Extraterrestrial Life (21st Century Bks., 1996) and Elaine Landau's UFOs (Millbrook, 1995), this title serves as an exciting introduction to a dynamic field. Some topics such as crop circles, Stonehenge, and Easter Island statues are included in both of Wilson's works. Flashy and tantalizing, these two volumes are more amusing than informative.?Ann G.

Clark did his graduate work on bacterial antibiotic resistance to earn his Ph.D. from Bristol University, in the West of England. During this time, he visited the British Government's biological warfare facility at Porton Down and was privileged to walk inside the (disused) Black Death fermenter. He later crossed the Atlantic to work as a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University and then the University of Illinois. David Clark recently retired from teaching Molecular Biology and Bacterial Physiology at Southern Illinois University which he joined in 1981. His research into the Regulation of Alcohol Fermentation in E. coli was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, from 1982 till 2007. From 1984-1991 he was also involved in a project to use genetically altered bacteria to remove contaminating sulfur from coal, jointly funded by the US Department of Energy and the Illinois Coal Development Board. In 1991 he received a Royal Society Guest Research Fellowship to work at Sheffield University, England while on sabbatical leave. He has supervised 11 master&#x2019;s and 7 PhD students and published approximately 70 articles in scientific journals. He has written or co-authored several textbooks, starting with Molecular Biology Made Simple and Fun (with Lonnie Russell; (Cache River Press, First edition, 1997) which is now in its fourth edition. Other books are Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (both published by Elsevier) He recently wrote a popular science book, Germs, Genes, &amp; Civilization: How Epidemics Shaped Who We Are Today (2010, Financial Times Press/Pearson).

This book applies ideas of shelter and welcome to journeys of life, using poetry, story, biblical reflection, and prose to open up gentle ways of living well in a troubled world. The fourth gospel tells of Jesus arriving in the room where the disciples are gathered, full of fear, on Easter Sunday. He does not chide or admonish; instead he says "Peace be with you," which, in the Aramaic of his day, was simply a greeting. "Hello," he said, welcoming people locked in a room of fear to a place of deep encounter; encounter with themselves, with their fear, with each other, and with the incarnate one in their midst. Interweaving everyday stories with analysis, gospel reflections with mindfulness, and Celtic spirituality with poetry, this book explores the practice of welcoming as a spiritual discipline. In particular, it features careful stories of welcoming parts of life that are often unwelcome.</p></p><p><b>P�draig � Tuama</b> is a poet and theologian.

Among the producers are Antoine, Brahm, Grein, Granville-Baker, Nemirovich-Danchenko and Stanislavsky.

Selling tax liens or tax deeds (depending on the state) are the two ways that counties across the country bring delinquent property taxes up-to-date. This investment is one of the least publicized and safest ways of investing in real estate, designed to give the investor either a fixed return, as in the case of investing in tax liens, or a property for 10 to 50 cents on the dollar, as in the case of a tax deed sale. In most situations, the property is ultimately transferred free of any liens, such as mortgages. <i>Profit by Investing in Real Estate Tax Liens</i> also debunks the common myth that tax delinquent properties are run-down and shows that liens exist on every type of property. Author Larry Loftis, an attorney and active investor, has purchased liens on properties owned by Julius "Dr. J" Erving, Hector "Macho" Camacho (world champion boxer), <i>Chase Manhattan Bank</i>, <i>LaSalle National Bank</i>, and even a building whose major tenant was the local sheriff's department! In this authoritative guide, Loftis helps investors avoid the pitfalls while answering all the key questions they need to consider: <br> * What's the difference between investing in tax liens and tax deeds? <br> * How does an investor go about bidding at tax sales? And what is the process? <br> * What are the different requirements in each state? <br> * Where are the greatest risks in this kind of real estate investing? For investors eager to get started, Loftis's action plan provides details on the next steps to take, while real-life examples in every chapter bring the concepts down to earth.</p><p>Over the years, real estate expert and author <b>Larry Loftis</b> has bought and sold millions of dollars worth of real estate investments, including foreclosures, lease options, tax liens and deeds, resort properties, and multi-family housing.

Eliot called `The Moonstone the first and greatest English detective novel. The novel is worthy of such praise. The story begins with a brief prologue describing how the famous yellow diamond was captured during a military campaign in India by a British officer in 1799. The action moves quickly to 1848 England, where, according to the British officers will, the diamond has been given to one of the soldiers young relatives, Rachel Verinder. Yet only hours after the diamond arrives at the Verinder estate, it disappears. Was it stolen by a relative? A servant? And who are these three Indian men who keep hanging around the estate? `The Moonstone is told from the point of view of several characters. The first portion of the tale is told by Gabriel Betteredge, house steward of the Verinder estate, who has been working for the family practically his entire life. Betteredges account holds the readers interest as he introduces the main players and the crime itself. The next account, by distant Verinder relative Miss Clack, is humorous and somewhat important. But after Miss Clacks account, things really take off at breakneck speed. Readers who latch onto the T.S. Eliot quote expecting a modern detective tale will be sorely disappointed. You aren&#39;t going to see anything resembling Jeffrey Deaver, James Patterson, Sue Grafton, or even Mary Higgins Clark. You also wont see Mickey Spillane, Dashiel Hammett, or Raymond Chandler. Nor will you see Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, or Martha Grimes. You wont even see Arthur Conan Doyle. But you WILL see the novel that influenced them all. You&#39;ll also see something else. Something that modern mystery/detective writers have for the most part lost. Characters. Oh sure, modern writers have characters, but for the most part, the reader only learns enough about the character to forward the plot. In our time, plot is King.</p><p>The Broadview Literary Texts series is an effort to represent the ever-changing canon of literature in English by bringing together texts long regarded as classics with valuable, though lesser-known literature.The elements which make up The Moonstone- a purloined Indian jewel which carries with it a mysterious curse, a stolid British police sergeant, a drama of theft and murder in a spacious country home- have been repeated, in slightly varying guises, throughout much of the detective fiction that Wilkie Collins&#39; immensely popular 1868 novel gave birth to.</p><h2>Evidence-Based Teaching in Nursing: A Foundation for Educators</h2><p>Evidence-Based Teaching in Nursing: A Foundation for Educators, Second Edition focuses on providing potential and current nursing faculty with the tools and knowledge they need to achieve highly successful outcomes for teaching nursing students and staff.

In virtue of his omnipotence and perfect goodness, the author shows, God must be a Trinity, live a human life in order to share our suffering, and found a church which would enable him to tell all humans about this. It is also quite probable that he would provide his human life as atonement for our wrongdoing, teach us how we should live, and tell us his plans for our future after death. Among founders of religions, Jesus uniquely satisfies the requirement of living the sort of human life which God would need to have lived. But to give us adequate reason to believe that Jesus was God, God would need to put his "signature" on the life of Jesus by an act which he alone could do--raise him from the dead. And there is adequate historical evidence that Jesus rose from the dead.<br></p><p><br><strong>Richard Swinburne</strong> was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Keele; Nolloth Professor of the Philosophy of the Christian Religion, University of Oxford, and Fellow of the British Academy. He is the author of many books on the nature and justification of religious belief, and on other areas of philosophy including the philosophy of mind and epistemology.<br>Swinburne shreds the popular perception&#x2014;fostered by Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, and other prominent atheists&#x2014;that intelligent reasoning invariably leads to unbelief. For in this formidably argued analysis, readers see a powerful mind defending Christian faith as both rational and coherent. After first establishing the plausibility of God as creator of the world, Swinburne establishes a chain of logic justifying acceptance of Jesus as the divine incarnation of that God. As links in that chain, scriptural accounts of the miracles performed by Jesus fit within a consistent reading of the historical record. Swinburne argues with particular forcefulness for the reality of Jesus&#x2019; physical Resurrection, carefully scrutinizing&#x2014;and rejecting&#x2014;the major skeptical theories for explaining the empty tomb. Focusing on doctrines generally shared by Christians, Swinburne declines to settle divisive questions of ecclesiastical authority and scriptural interpretation. Tough-minded materialists may find Swinburne unconvincing, and average churchgoers may not wish to parse the fine points of hypostasis and Monophysites. But this book will attract theologically serious Christians and intellectually honest doubters. --Bryce Christensen</p><h2>Maya for Games: Modeling and Texturing Techniques with Maya and Mudbox</h2><p>Well-known Maya professional, Michael Ingrassia, takes readers through his unique style of modeling: "Image Based Modeling" where efficient, realistic models can be created very quickly. Ingrassia's techniques allow modelers to create exact replicas of their concept characters or objects. The techniques presented are very efficient and allow game modelers to quickly build out stand alone props to populate environments and game levels. <br><br>Presented are tried and true techniques that the author has used successfully in game production for the past 10 years. Most, if not all 3D books, focus on basic "box" modeling techniques, which are the basis for proper 3D modeling but not the complete solution. In the author's experience, students who have learned through the Image Based Modeling brand, have quickly excelled into effective modelers. <br><br>One of the hardest things for any modeler to do is match their model EXACTLY to the concept art or photos they are provided. The insider tips in this book walk artists through this process. Artists begin with basic modeling and advance to a creating a complete scene and set design/game level. Rather than including sporadic models with zero association from to one another, each model in the book becomes an integral part of an overall theme realistic in game development today. <br><br>The accompanying DVD includes 8 exclusive video tutorials on advanced Maya techniques as bonus tracks for artists providing invaluable modeling, rigging and texturing samples. Also, an in-depth video on assembling a "Killer Demo Reel" showing simple but effective video editing techniques used by the author so that artists can learn how to get their work seen. The book not only teaches effective methodology, but provides the user with impressive content for producing effective demo reels and portfolios.

Sensing the Future: Moholy-Nagy, Media and the Arts considers the impact of technology by exploring ways it was addressed in the practice of the Hungarian polymath artist L�szl� Moholy-Nagy (1895-1946), a prominent professor at the Bauhaus and a key figure in the history of Modernism. Moholy-Nagy felt that people needed guidance to cope with the onslaught of sensory input in an increasingly technologized, mediatized, hyper-stimulating environment. His ideas informed media theorists such as Walter Benjamin, John Cage, Sigfried Giedion, and Marshall McLuhan, who anticipated digital culture as it emerged. Should we then regard Moholy-Nagy as a pioneer of the digital? His aesthetic engagement with the technology/body problematic broached the notions of immersion, interactivity and bodily participation, innately offering a critique of today&#x2019;s disembodiment. Was he then both a pioneer and a proto-critic of the digital? This book is intended to introduce this seminal figure of post-medial practices to younger generations and, by including responses to his work by contemporary artists, to reflect on the ways in which his work is relevant to artistic practice now.</p><p></p><h2>The Small Bachelor</h2><p>For George Finch, one of nature&#x2019;s white mice and probably the worst artist ever to put brush to canvas, there are many obstacles to marriage &#x2014; the greatest being his beloved Molly&#x2019;s fearsome stepmother, Mrs. Waddington, who has her eye on an eligible English lord for a son-in-law.</p><p>P.G.

Her intransigence led to a beating&#x2015;and to the end of most foreign missions in Egypt&#x2015;and contributed to the rise of Islamist organizations. Turkiyya Hasan left the Swedish Salaam Mission with scratches on her legs and a suitcase of evidence of missionary misdeeds. Her story hit a nerve among Egyptians, and news of the beating quickly spread through the country. Suspicion of missionary schools, hospitals, and homes increased, and a vehement anti-missionary movement swept the country. That missionaries had won few converts was immaterial to Egyptian observers: stories such as Turkiyya's showed that the threat to Muslims and Islam was real. This is a great story of unintended consequences: Christian missionaries came to Egypt to convert and provide social services for children. Their actions ultimately inspired the development of the Muslim Brotherhood and similar Islamist groups. In <i>The Orphan Scandal</i>, Beth Baron provides a new lens through which to view the rise of Islamic groups in Egypt. This fresh perspective offers a starting point to uncover hidden links between Islamic activists and a broad cadre of Protestant evangelicals. Exploring the historical aims of the Christian missions and the early efforts of the Muslim Brotherhood, Baron shows how the Muslim Brotherhood and like-minded Islamist associations developed alongside and in reaction to the influx of missionaries. Patterning their organization and social welfare projects on the early success of the Christian missions, the Brotherhood launched their own efforts to "save" children and provide for the orphaned, abandoned, and poor. In battling for Egypt's children, Islamic activists created a network of social welfare institutions and a template for social action across the country&#x2015;the effects of which, we now know, would only gain power and influence across the country in the decades to come.</p><p>Beth Baron is Professor of History at City College and Director of the Middle East and Middle Eastern American Center at The Graduate Center, CUNY.

(Kathryn Kish Sklar <i>SUNY Binghamton</i>)<br><br>"Beth Baron tells a dramatic story about Western missionary fantasies to convert the Middle East and about a variety of Muslim Egyptian responses to these missionary fantasies. She charts the major unintended consequence of this missionary project, namely the emergence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement and the rise of the Muslim welfare state in Egypt. Beautifully narrated, and drawing on both Arabic and English-language sources, Baron humanizes all sides of the missionary encounter in Egypt. This is an important book."

It commences with a historical study followed by a series of anthropological accounts that examine the problems that arise when depression is assessed in other cultures. This is a work of impressive scholarship which demonstrates that anthropological approaches to affect and illness raise central questions for psychiatry and psychology, and that cross-cultural studies of depression raise equally provocative questions for anthropology.</p><p>"This is the most complete, scholarly and provocative collection of reviews that attempt to separate what is the universal biological 'core' from what represents cultural contributions in depressive illness.

Are some forecasts more likely to be accurate than others, and why? <i>Making Sense of Weather and Climate </i>takes readers through key topics in atmospheric physics and presents a cogent view of how weather relates to climate, particularly climate-change science. It is the perfect book for amateur meteorologists and weather enthusiasts, and for anyone whose livelihood depends on navigating the weather's twists and turns. <br><br><i>Making Sense of Weather and Climate</i> begins by explaining the essential mechanics and characteristics of this fascinating science. The noted physics author Mark Denny also defines the crucial differences between weather and climate, and then develops from this basic knowledge a sophisticated yet clear portrait of their relation. Throughout, Denny elaborates on the role of weather forecasting in guiding politics and other aspects of human civilization. He also follows forecasting's effect on the economy. Denny's exploration of the science and history of a phenomenon we have long tried to master makes this book a unique companion for anyone who wants a complete picture of the environment's individual, societal, and planetary impact.</p><p>Mark Denny is the author of<i> Lights On! The Science of Power Generation</i> (2013); <i>The Science of Navigation: From Dead Reckoning to GPS</i> (2012); <i>Their Arrows Will Darken the Sun: The Evolution and Science of Ballistics </i>(2011); <i>Super Structures: The Science of Bridges, Buildings, Dams, and Other Feats of Engineering</i> (2010); and <i>Blip, Ping, and Buzz: Making Sense of Radar and Sonar</i> (2007).The book is perfect for any individual who wants "textbook" science delivered in a format that is easily digested and exciting to read. <i>Making Sense of Weather and Climate</i> fills a niche not only between popular and college-level science, but also between the too-often separated topics of weather and climate change. Frequently presented as separate issues, Denny makes clear that the two are in fact very linked. (Scott Mandia, Suffolk County Community College)<br><br>Weather has always interested people and has always been societally relevant. Climate change is by now at a similar level of public interest and relevance. <i>Making Sense of Weather and Climate</i> delivers a popular science overview of the physics of weather and climate, with a good amount of wit. Denny's approach to the subject from an applied physics perspective is a real advantage: neither too technical nor too descriptive, this book is for anyone who wants to learn more about weather and climate. (Thomas Birner, Colorado State University)<br><br>Mark Denny's is a beautifully written, lucid story of the science of climate and weather. It explores its subjects deeply but makes them accessible to the non-technical reader; it captures the humanity of the scientific endeavor; and it describes how scientists observe weather, the statistical prism through which they must view the observations, and how they use them to construct models to render complex phenomena understandable.

Avoiding the shock and awe of wartime images, it explores the contemporary spatial configurations of power camouflaged in the infrastructures, environments, and scales of military operations. Instead of wartime highs, this book starts with drawdown lows, when demobilization and decommissioning morph into realignment and prepositioning. It is in this transitional milieu that the full material magnitudes and geographic entanglements of contemporary militarism are laid bare. Through this perpetual cycle of build up and breakdown, the U.S. Department of Defense&#x2015;the single largest developer, landowner, equipment contractor, and energy consumer in the world&#x2015;has engineered a planetary assemblage of &#x201c;operational environments&#x201d; in which militarized, demilitarized, and non-militarized landscapes are increasingly inextricable. </p><p>In a series of critical cartographic essays, Pierre B�langer and Alexander Arroyo trace this footprint far beyond the battlefield, countermapping the geographies of U.S. militarism across five of the most important and embattled operational environments: the ocean, the atmosphere, the highway, the city, and the desert. From the Indian Ocean atoll of Diego Garcia to the defense-contractor archipelago around Washington, D.C.; from the A01 Highway circling Afghanistan's high-altitude steppe to surveillance satellites pinging the planet from low-earth orbit; and from the vast cold chain conveying military perishables worldwide to the global constellation of military dumps, sinks, and scrapyards, the book unearths the logistical infrastructures and residual landscapes that render strategy spatial, militarism material, and power operational. In so doing, B�langer and Arroyo reveal unseen ecologies of power at work in the making and unmaking of environments&#x2015;operational, built, and otherwise&#x2015;to come.</p></p><p>Pierre B�langer, an independent landscape architect and urbanist, is editor of <i>Extraction Empire: Undermining the Systems, States, and Scales of Canada's Global Resource Empire</i>, coauthor of&nbsp;<i>Ecologies of Power: Countermapping the Logistical Landscapes and Military Geographies of the U.S. Department of Defense</i>&nbsp;(both published by the MIT Press), and <i>Landscape as Infrastructure</i>, <i>Going Live: from States to Systems.</i><p>B�langer and Arroyo recalibrate how we understand relations of military and urban space, expertly linking disparate and often invisible logics and landscapes.

In his classic treatise, Turner, the first professionally trained African American linguist, focused on a people whose language had long been misunderstood, lifted a shroud that had obscured the true history of Gullah, and demonstrated that it drew important linguistic features directly from the languages of West Africa. Initially published in 1949, this groundbreaking work of Afrocentric scholarship opened American minds to a little-known culture while initiating a means for the Gullah people to reclaim and value their past.

In "The Lottery," Jackson's most famous work and one of the greatest--and scariest--stories of the twentieth century, a small town gathers for an annual ritual that culminates in a terrible event. In "The Daemon Lover," a woman waits, then searches, for the man she is to marry that day, only to find that he has disappeared as completely as if he had never existed. In "Trial by Combat," a shy woman confronts her kleptomaniac neighbor, and in "Pillar of Salt," a tourist in New York is gradually paralyzed by a city grown nightmarish. Throughout these twenty-five tales, we move through a variety of emotional landscapes full of loneliness and humor, oddity and cruelty, banality and terror, and searing psychological insight. No reader will come away unaffected.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only collection to appear during Jackson's lifetime, The Lottery and Other Stories reveals the full breadth and power of this truly original writer.</p><p><br>"Jackson's great gift is not to create a world of fantasy and terror, but rather to discover the existence of the grotesque in the ordinary world. The grotesque is so powerful here just because it takes off from everyday life and constantly returns there until we do not know ourselves quite where we are."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Elizabeth Janeway<br><br>Shirley Jackson (1919&#x2013;1965) wrote several books, including <i>Hangsaman</i>, <i>Life Among the Savages</i>, and <i>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</i>.</p><h2>The Norton Anthology of Contemporary Fiction</h2><p><p><strong>In this Second Edition of <em>The Norton Anthology of Contemporary Fiction</em>, master teachers and writers R.V.

Volume IV attempts to understand the men who managed the empire, their priorities and visions as leaders, and the mechanisms of control which held the empire together. There are chapters on imperial centers of activity, on the geographical periphery of the empire, and on the entirety of its connecting mechanisms, including institutions and the flow of people, money, goods, and services. Contributors also explore the experiences of Britain's imperial subjects in culture, politics, and economics--those experiences which fostered the growth of vibrant, and often new, national identities and movements as well as--ultimately--new nation-states.

President Gerald Ford&#x2015;the first (and only) non-elected president of the United States&#x2015;found himself in the midst of an intense four-day international crisis with significant historical ramifications.<br> The Mayaguez incident was the first test of the president&#x2019;s role as commander-in-chief since the enactment of the 1973 War Powers Act, which was intended to limit presidential power. While the Ford administration&#x2019;s swift and violent reaction achieved its stated goals of enhancing U.S. prestige and rescuing the ship and crew, Robert J. Mahoney&#x2019;s analysis of the events demonstrates that the end result was largely a matter of extreme good fortune. Mahoney examines the reason for the failure of correct intelligence to reach the invading U.S. force, explores the circumstances that worked in America&#x2019;s favor, and details the decision-making process from the National Security Council through the operational levels down to the tactical forces.<br> With access to recently declassified primary sources, Mahoney shows how this short but intense crisis helped spur the most radical restructuring of the Department of Defense since its inception in 1947&#x2015;and highlights issues of access and information that still reverberate today.</p><p><br>Col.

He lives in Woodbridge, Va.<br>Mere weeks after the 1975 Communist conquests of Cambodia and South Vietnam, American leaders instantly perceived the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s seizure of an American merchant ship and crew as an intolerable affront to national prestige. There are other books about the ensuing military events of the Mayaguez incident (e.g., The Last Battle, by Ralph Wetterhahn, 2001); this one examines the top-level decision making behind the combat. Tapping into transcripts of meetings of the National Security Council, Mahoney observes that President Ford&#x2019;s order for military retaliation was made quickly, and his narrative minutely takes the pulse through the chain of command of Ford&#x2019;s resolution. Since the crisis had a mixed result&#x2014;strategic success (safe return of ship and crew) but tactical failure (91 American casualties)&#x2014;Mahoney searches for explanations of operational snafus and identifies, among other factors, Ford&#x2019;s determination to act fast to foil repetition of the similar 1968 Pueblo incident and a defective distribution of intelligence to combat forces.

Ask the children in your ministry what they love about your ministry and you're almost guaranteed to hear, "Playing games." Play is an integral part of childhood. And it's an integral part of ministry, too. As children play, they're having fun while they're learning. Games teach children about patience, respect, cooperation, and encouragement. </p><p>Games involve everyone, and they're a powerful tool for making a point. If you wanted to teach children about David and Goliath, you could sit them down in rows, tell them the story, and have them color in a picture of David. Or...you could have them play Human Slingshots (page 110), in which they link arms to make "slings" and launch paper "rocks" at a nine-foot-high target. Which do you think children will remember? Which will they enjoy? </p><p>The Humongous Book of Games for Children's Ministry has hundreds of games that connect with many different topics and hundreds of different Scriptures. The book is divided into three main sections: "Preschool Games," "Lower Elementary Games," and "Upper Elementary Games." If you're teaching your preschoolers about a topic and you need an opening game, just look at the table of contents to find the game that fits the point you're making. If you want your fifth-graders to understand a certain Scripture passage, just turn to the "Scripture Index" in the back to find the game that brings the passage to life. If your second-graders need a change of pace, turn to the "Energy Level Index" to find a high-energy game to liven things up. </p><p>The Humongous Book of Games for Children's Ministry probably has all the games you'll need. Have fun laughing, learning, and playing!</p></p><h2>Hagar Bible Study Guide: In the Face of Rejection, God Says I&#x2019;m Significant (Known by Name)</h2><p><p>The women in the Bible asked the same three questions we all still ask today: <em>How does everyone else see me? How do I see myself? How does God see me?</em></p><p>Hagar&#x2019;s story, found in Genesis 16, is a story of cultural victimization. She was betrayed, abandoned, and scorned. Her response? She did what most of us would do when deeply hurt by someone we trust&#x2013;she ran away. She got defensive. She retreated to a place where she felt safe. She felt justified in her anger and hurt. But deep in her core was a woman who longed to be seen and hoped for redemption.</p><p>This Bible study will take you through Hagar&#x2019;s story as she learns from hurt and heartache that what is unresolved is not unseen by God. The lack of finality in Hagar&#x2019;s story teaches us to trust God with the ending&#x2013;believing he sees us and he knows.</p><p>This study guide features video notes, group discussion questions, and between-session activities like reflecting on the drama and teachings, studying the character story in Scripture, memory verses, and journaling.</p><p>Sessions include:</p><ol><li>Exposing the Lie of Shame</li><li>Rejected to Accepted</li><li>Trusting after Betrayal</li><li>Transformed and Seen</li></ol><p>Designed for use with <em>Known By Name: Hagar Video Study </em>(9780310096498), sold separately.</p></p><p><p>Kasey Van Norman is a professional counselor, Bible teacher, and the author of the books and study series, <em>Named by God</em> and <em>Raw Faith</em>.

A poet and a storyteller, the author consistently achieves the right tone that challenges our preconceptions. From the unexpurgated story of a young woman reliving the horrors of the massacre to dialogues between strangers meeting across the past, and finally to her own reflections. Her prose alternates between raw and poetic, but always remains discreet, respectful and dignified. The one thing that comes through her narrative voice is a ray of hope. The translator Veronique Wakerley lectures in French at the University of Zimbabwe and is particularly interested in the literature of the first part of the twentieth century.</p></p><p>Veronique Tadjo is a writer, illustrator and painter from Cote d&#39;Ivoire.

Each chapter then deals with a different illustrative technique - drawing in the field during survey work and excavation, drawing artefacts, buildings and reconstructions, producing artwork for publication and the early uses of computer graphics. Information about appropriate equipment, as well as a guide to manufacturers, is also supplied. An obvious and important feature of Archaeological Illustration is the 120 line drawings and half-tones which show the right - and the wrong - way of producing drawings. This volume will therefore be of interest to amateur and professional archaeologists alike.</p><p>This volume, originally published in 1989, is intended as a practical guide to archaeological illustration, from drawing finds in the field to technical studio drawing for publication.

Crowley argues that due to its association with literary studies in English departments, composition instruction has been inappropriately influenced by humanist pedagogy and that modern humanism is not a satisfactory rationale for the study of writing. Crowley envisions possible nonhumanist rationales that could be developed for vertical curricula in writing instruction, were the universal requirement not in place.</p> <p><i>Composition in the University</i> examines the required introductory course in composition within American colleges and universities. According to Sharon Crowley, the required composition course has never been conceived in the way that other introductory courses have been&#x2014;as an introduction to the principles and practices of a field of study. Rather it has been constructed throughout much of its history as a site from which larger educational and ideological agendas could be advanced, and such agendas have not always served the interests of students or teachers, even though they are usually touted as programs of study that students &#x201c;need.&#x201d;<br> <br> If there is a master narrative of the history of composition, it is told in the institutional attitude that has governed administration, design, and staffing of the course from its beginnings&#x2014;the attitude that the universal requirement is in place in order to construct docile academic subjects.</p> <p>Crowley argues that due to its association with literary studies in English departments, composition instruction has been inappropriately influenced by humanist pedagogy and that modern humanism is not a satisfactory rationale for the study of writing. She examines historical attempts to reconfigure the required course in nonhumanist terms, such as the advent of communications studies during the 1940s. Crowley devotes two essays to this phenomenon, concentrating on the furor caused by the adoption of a communications program at the University of Iowa. <br> <br> <i>Composition in the University</i> concludes with a pair of essays that argue against maintenance of the universal requirement. In the last of these, Crowley envisions possible nonhumanist rationales that could be developed for vertical curricula in writing instruction, were the universal requirement not in place.<br> <br> Crowley presents her findings in a series of essays because she feels the history of the required composition course cannot easily be understood as a coherent narrative since understandings of the purpose of the required course have altered rapidly from decade to decade, sometimes in shockingly sudden and erratic fashion.<br> <br> The essays in this book are informed by Crowley&#x2019;s long career of teaching composition, administering a composition program, and training teachers of the required introductory course. The book also draw on experience she gained while working with committees formed by the Conference on College Composition and Communication toward implementation of the Wyoming Resolution, an attempt to better the working conditions of post-secondary teachers of writing.</p> <p></p></p><p></p><h2>Teaching Reading In Social Studies, Science and Math (Theory and Practice)</h2><p>Help students read and engage with textbooks, and navigate the special demands of any non-fiction text structure.

On one side, there sits the open, light, friendly, and democratic constituent. And, on the other hand, is its moody counterpart: sleek and sophisticated; timeless and traditional; and deeply rooted in the sensations and juxtapositions of nature. Within the lines of tile-covered roofs born from the existence of nearby clay deposits and large windows that let in light during the shorter winter days, insight into this special thread of skilled craftsmanship awaits. <em>Scandinavia Dreaming</em> presents dazzling interiors, architecture, and products that show the richness, variety, and intensity of contemporary Nordic spaces.</p> <p>The projects within <em>Scandinavia Dreaming</em> translate to any four walls and readily invite transformation from page to reality. Told through anecdotes from those who live in them and from those who exist in other sectors of the creative community, <em>Scandinavia Dreaming</em> tells of a design school that has a worldwide reputation for its effortless combination of classical restraint and warm materials.</p></p><p>Angel Trinidad is an editor and writer based in Amsterdam.

But who were these people? What do we know of their lives and the ways in which they influenced their societies?<br> &nbsp;<br> In&nbsp;<i>Islamic Civilization in Thirty Lives</i>, the distinguished historian of Islam Chase F. Robinson draws on the long tradition in Muslim scholarship of commemorating in writing the biographies of notable figures, but he weaves these ambitious lives together to create a rich narrative of Islamic civilization, from the Prophet Muhammad in the seventh century to the era of the world conquerer Timur and the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in the fifteenth.<br> &nbsp;<br> Beginning in Islam&#x2019;s heartland, Mecca, and ranging from North Africa and Iberia in the west to Central and East Asia, Robinson not only traces the rise and fall of Islamic states through the biographies of political and military leaders who worked to secure peace or expand their power, but also discusses those who developed Islamic law, scientific thought, and literature. What emerges is a fascinating portrait of rich and diverse Islamic societies. Alongside the famous characters who colored this landscape&#x2014;including Muhammad&#x2019;s cousin &#x2019;Ali; the Crusader-era hero Saladin; and the poet Rumi&#x2014;are less well-known figures, such as Ibn Fadlan, whose travels in Eurasia brought fascinating first-hand accounts of the Volga Vikings to the Abbasid Caliph; the eleventh-century Karima al-Marwaziyya, a woman scholar of Prophetic traditions; and Abu al-Qasim Ramisht, a twelfth-century merchant millionaire.<br> &nbsp;<br> An illuminating read for anyone interested in learning more about this often-misunderstood civilization, this book creates a vivid picture of life in all arenas of the pre-modern Muslim world.</p><p><b>Chase F. Robinson</b> was Lecturer and Professor of Islamic History in the Faculty of Oriental Studies and Fellow of Wolfson College at the University of Oxford from 1993 until 2008, when he was appointed Distinguished Professor of History and Provost of the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, where he now serves as President. His extensive publications on Islamic history include <i>Islamic Historiography</i>, <i>Empire and Elites after the Muslim Conquest,</i>&nbsp;and <i>The New Cambridge History of Islam, Volume 1.</i>"&nbsp;...an elegant digest of the many colourful, creative and technologically innovative manifestations that the Prophet Muhammad inspired from his seventh-century oases in the Arabian peninsula." (<i>The Economist</i> 2016-12-05)<br><br>"Robinson delivers a fascinating snapshot of Islamic history through 30 brief biographies. By including a mixture of the usual suspects (Muhammad, Ali, Saladin) and the unexpected (Ibn Hazm, Ibn Muqla, Abu al-Qasim), the author offers readers a rich variety of lives in pre-Islamic history."&nbsp; (<i>CHOICE</i> 2017-04-01)<br><br>"In a survey course covering the period, Robinson&#x2019;s would make an excellent text to use to introduce more in depth and comprehensive material. The engagingly written biographies will make the topic more accessible to students while also drawing out the variety of individuals who made up 'Islamic civilization.' The author&#x2019;s attention to political economy will in simple fashion help students grasp underlying concepts with which they sometimes struggle."

Yet this has been accompanied by a range of social and personal disorders, including family breakdown, addiction, mental instability, crime, obesity, inequality, economic insecurity, and declining trust.<br><br>Avner Offer argues that well-being has lagged behind affluence in these societies, because they present an environment in which consistent choices are difficult to achieve over different time ranges and in which the capacity for personal and social commitment is undermined by the flow of novelty. His approach draws on economics and social science, makes use of the latest cognitive research, and provides a detailed and reasoned critique of modern consumer society, especially the assumption that freedom of choice necessarily maximizes individual and social well-being.<br><br>The book falls into three parts. Part one analyses the ways in which economic resources map on to human welfare, why choice is so intractable, and how commitment to people and institutions is sustained. It argues that choice is constrained by prior obligation and reciprocity. The second section then applies these conceptual arguments to comparative empirical studies of advertising, of eating and obesity, and of the production and acquisition of appliances and automobiles. Finally, in part three, Offer investigates social and personal relations in the USA and Britain, including inter-personal regard, the rewards and reversals of status, the social and psychological costs of inequality, and the challenges posed to heterosexual love and to parenthood by the rise of affluence.<br></p><p><br><strong>Avner Offer</strong> is Chichele Professor of Economic History at the University of Oxford and Fellow of All Souls College.

The differing ideas that divide believers into four major points-of-view are examined in the <i>Four Views of the End Times</i> pamphlet. This bestseller tackles Pre- and Post-millennialism, as well as Historic Premillennialism and Amillennialism in12 panels of objective information. For each view, the glossy full-color pamphlet includes a definition of the position with supporting Scriptures, a time line of the view&#x2019;s popularity, and a sampling of Christian leaders supporting that view. <i>Size: 8.5"x 5.5" unfolds to 33" long. Fits inside most Bible covers.</i><br> &nbsp; The events leading up to the return of Jesus Christ are controversial, and many Christians identify with one of four positions: Dispensational Premillennialism, Historic Premillennialism, Amillennialism, or Postmillennialism. The <i>Four Views of the End Times</i> pamphlet makes the viewpoints and their biblical support easy to understand. Packed with information regarding what Jesus and Paul taught about the end times, the pamphlet also includes a list of important terms and their definitions, such as: <ul> <li>Church</li> <li>Eschatology</li> <li>Rapture</li> <li>The Great Tribulation</li> <li>Preterism</li> </ul> &nbsp; <i>Four Views of the End Times </i>pamphlet addresses end-time eschatology, outlining the four major points of view regarding events leading up to the second coming of Christ.

It considers what characteristics of the human mind make it possible to acquire language and to what extent acquisition is biologically programmed and influenced by our environment. It inquires as to what makes second language learning (in adulthood) different from first language acquisition; and whether the specific stages in language development are universal across languages. It will be a key text for courses in linguistics, developmental psychology and cognitive science.</p><p>The remarkable way in which young children acquire their first language has long fascinated linguists and developmental psychologists alike. Language is a skill that we have essentially mastered by the age of three, and with incredible ease and speed, despite the complexity of the task. This accessible textbook introduces the field of child language acquisition, exploring language development from birth. Clear and comprehensive, it is set to become a key text for all courses in child language acquisition, within linguistics, developmental psychology and cognitive science.Barbara Lust is Professor in the Department of Human Development, Cornell University, New York.</p><h2>An Elementary Introduction to Mathematical Finance: Options and other Topics</h2><p>This original text on the basics of option pricing is accessible to readers with limited mathematical training.

This book brings together a selection of essays from the past two decades that build a powerful argument that any scientifically and philosophically satisfactory view of &nbsp;mind and thought must ultimately explain how bodily perception and action give rise to cognition, meaning, language, action, and values.<br> &nbsp;<br> A brief account of Johnson&#x2019;s own intellectual journey, through which we track some of the most important discoveries in the field over the past forty years, sets the stage. Subsequent chapters set out Johnson&#x2019;s important role in embodied cognition theory, including his cofounding (with George Lakoff) of conceptual metaphor theory and, later, their theory of bodily structures and processes that underlie all meaning, conceptualization, and reasoning. A detailed account of how meaning arises from our physical engagement with our environments provides the basis for a nondualistic, nonreductive view of mind that he sees as most congruous with the latest cognitive science. A concluding section explores the implications of our embodiment for our understanding of knowledge, reason, and truth. The resulting book will be essential for all philosophers dealing with mind, thought, and language.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Mark Johnson</b> is the Philip H. Knight Professor of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Oregon.<br> &nbsp;"Mark Johnson shows us what pragmatism can do, and especially its relevance to questions about the embodied mind. Building on his own groundbreaking work in the philosophy of language, he provides an insightful answer to the question of meaning: meaning emerges in the interactions of our bodies with our structured environments, and this meaning includes not only everyday pragmatic meaning, but philosophical and scientific reasoning as well." (Shaun Gallagher, University of Memphis)<br><br>"Mark Johnson&#x2019;s early books, especially <i>Metaphors We Live By</i> and <i>The Body in the Mind</i>, were absolutely critical in the founding of embodied cognitive science.

In the tradition of that work, editor in chief Kermit L. Hall offers up The Oxford Companion to American Law, a one-volume, A-Z encyclopedia that covers topics ranging from aging and the law, wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping, the Salem Witch Trials and Plessy vs. Ferguson.<br>The Companion takes as its starting point the insight that law is embedded in society, and that to understand American law one must necessarily ask questions about the relationship between it and the social order, now and in the past. The volume assumes that American law, in all its richness and complexity, cannot be understood in isolation, as simply the business of the Supreme Court, or as a list of common law doctrines. Hence, the volume takes seriously issues involving laws role in structuring decisions about governance, the significance of state and local law and legal institutions, and the place of American law in a comparative international perspective. Nearly 500 entries are included, written by over 300 expert contributors.<br> Intended for the working lawyer or judge, the high school student working on a term paper, or the general adult reader interested in the topic, the Companion is the authoritative reference work on the subject of American law.<br></p><p>President of Utah State University, Kermit Hall has written extensively about the history of American law, constitutionalism, and judicial behaviour, especially the development of the Supreme Court. His Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States and the Oxford Guide to Supreme<br>Court Decisions have won several awards. He is also an expert on openness in government, serving from 1994 to 1998 as one of five members of the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board.This title bills itself as "a comprehensive guide to every aspect of law in America." Although that statement is hyperbole, this is perhaps the best one-volume encyclopedia of American law to be published in a long time. Editor Hall, president of Utah State University and a specialist in the history of law, has overseen another Oxford title--<i>Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States</i> (Oxford, 1992)--that will be a standard for many years. His group of contributors includes legal and historical scholars, faculty of law schools, judges, and legal writers.<p>The book contains nearly 500 articles arranged in an A-Z format. Numerous <i>see also</i> references direct readers to similar topics in the book. Cross-references are denoted within the text for easy travel between articles. Individual cases of American law have, for the most part, been left out of the list of entry headings. There is an index to cases though; that leads readers to the article(s) where the case is discussed. A few extremely important or popular cases are included as entries <i>(Brown</i> v.<i> Board of Education; Leopold and Loeb case; Simpson, O. J., trials of)</i>. The same is true for people--only well-known or important historical figures are given individual articles.</p><p>Articles are generally several pages long and written at a level that is easily understood. Topics as arcane and confusing as intellectual property law and torts are explained with a minimum of legalese. With the ease of comprehension and the thorough main index, the volume is a good place for students to start school papers. College students will find the bibliography after each article useful in going further in their selected topics. Like law itself, the book is already out-of-date, as topics such as internment and privacy must be reconsidered after laws passed following the September 11, 2001, tragedy. However, this should not deter any library from purchasing this title. Readers will find a sometimes difficult topic covered in a simple, concise, and clear manner. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Forty years later, it remains a perennial bestseller and a definitive theoretical text. Its authors&#x2015;architects Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown, and Steven Izenour&#x2015;famously used the Las Vegas Strip to argue the virtues of the "ordinary and ugly" above the "heroic and original" qualities of architectural modernism. <i> Learning from Las Vegas</i> not only moved architecture to the center of cultural debates, it changed our ideas about what architecture was and could be.</p><p>In this provocative rereading of an iconic text, Aron Vinegar argues that to read <i>Learning from Las Vegas</i> only as an exemplary postmodernist text&#x2015;to understand it, for example, as a call for pastiche or as ironic provocation&#x2015;is to underestimate its deeper critical and ethical meaning, and to miss the underlying dialectic between skepticism and the ordinary, expression and the deadpan, that runs through the text.</p><p>Especially revealing is Vinegar's close analysis of the differences between the first 1972 edition, designed for the MIT Press by Muriel Cooper, and the "revised" edition of 1977, which was radically stripped down and largely redesigned by Denise Scott Brown.</p></p><p>Aron Vinegar is Assistant Professor in the Department of History of Art at Ohio State University.<p>Aron Vinegar literally reopens the book on architectural postmodernism. By reading <i> Learning from Las Vegas</i> as philosophy, not irony, Vinegar reaches out from American architecture in the 1970s to address architectural theory at large. It is a beguiling intervention. </p> (Simon Sadler, Professor of Architectural and Urban History, University of California, Davis)<br><br><p>While the powerful impact of <i>Complexity and Contradiction </i>has receded with time, <i>Learning from Las Vegas </i>still manages to provoke strong reactions and the sort of glib dismissal that is one way of warding off the challenge of a truly radical argument. Vinegar's wide-ranging discussion refreshes and re-opens a set of questions that have only grown more pressing in recent years, giving their original formulation the scholarly and critical attention they clearly deserve.</p> (Alan J.

He died in 1983 at the age of 72.</p>Despite being digitally remastered, this 1964 full-cast production featuring four of America's best stage actors doesn't quite work. They sound as if they're reading lines, rather than acting--they don't manage to make the listener suspend reality and enter the life of the play. Their Southern accents seem forced and the language stilted. In addition, as the actors wander in and out of range of the microphones, their voices strengthen, then fade. The third CD of the package contains rare recordings of Williams himself reading the opening dialogue and closing scene of the play, as well as several poems. It's interesting listening to his slightly nasal, gentle drawl, yet all in all, some archival material is best left on the shelf.

In the spirit of a sympathetic teacher, Robert Kegan guides us through this tricky curriculum, assessing the fit between its complex demands and our mental capacities, and showing what happens when we find ourselves, as we so often do, in over our heads. In this dazzling intellectual tour, he completely reintroduces us to the psychological landscape of our private and public lives. </p><p> A decade ago in <i>The Evolving Self</i>, Kegan presented a dynamic view of the development of human consciousness. Here he applies this widely acclaimed theory to the mental complexity of adulthood. As parents and partners, employees and bosses, citizens and leaders, we constantly confront a bewildering array of expectations, prescriptions, claims, and demands, as well as an equally confusing assortment of expert opinions that tell us what each of these roles entails. Surveying the disparate expert "literatures," which normally take no account of each other, Kegan brings them together to reveal, for the first time, what these many demands have in common.

Covers the fundamental algorithms of various fields, whether originally proposed for spoken or written language to demonstrate how the same algorithm can be used for speech recognition and word-sense disambiguation. Emphasis on web and other practical applications. Emphasis on scientific evaluation. <b></b>Useful as a reference for professionals in any of the areas of speech and language processing. </p></p><p>Preface <p> This is an exciting time to be working in speech and language processing. Historically distinct fields (natural language processing, speech recognition, computational linguistics, computational psycholinguistics) have begun to merge. The commercial availability of speech recognition and the need for Web-based language techniques have provided an important impetus for development of real systems. The availability of very large on-line corpora has enabled statistical models of language at every level, from phonetics to discourse. We have tried to draw on this emerging state of the art in the design of this pedagogical and reference work:</p><p>Coverage<br> In attempting to describe a unified vision of speech and language processing, we cover areas that traditionally are taught in different courses in different departments: speech recognition in electrical engineering; parsing, semantic interpretation, and pragmatics in natural language processing courses in computer science departments; and computational morphology and phonology in computational linguistics courses in linguistics departments. The book introduces the fundamental algorithms of each of these fields, whether originally proposed for spoken or written language, whether logical or statistical in origin, and attempts to tie together the descriptions of algorithms from different domains. We have also included coverage of applications like spelling-checking and information retrieval and extraction as well as areas like cognitive modeling. A potential problem with this broad-coverage approach is that it required us to include introductory material for each field; thus linguists may want to skip our description of articulatory phonetics, computer scientists may want to skip such sections as regular expressions, and electrical engineers skip the sections on signal processing. Of course, even in a book this long, we didn't have room for everything. Thus this book should not be considered a substitute for important relevant courses in linguistics, automata and formal language theory, or, especially, statistics and information theory. Emphasis on Practical Applications<br> It is important to show how language-related algorithms and techniques (from HMMs to unification, from the lambda calculus to transformation-based learning) can be applied to important real-world problems: spelling checking, text document search, speech recognition, Web-page processing, part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, and spoken-language dialogue agents. We have attempted to do this by integrating the description of language processing applications into each chapter. The advantage of this approach is that as the relevant linguistic knowledge is introduced, the student has the background to understand and model a particular domain. Emphasis on Scientific Evaluation<br> The recent prevalence of statistical algorithms in language processing and the growth of organized evaluations of speech and language processing systems has led to a new emphasis on evaluation. We have, therefore, tried to accompany most of our problem domains with a Methodology Box describing how systems are evaluated (e.g., including such concepts as training and test sets, cross-validation, and information-theoretic evaluation metrics like perplexity). Description of widely available language processing resources<br> Modern speech and language processing is heavily based on common resources: raw speech and text corpora, annotated corpora and treebanks, standard tagsets for labeling pronunciation, part-of-speech, parses, word-sense, and dialogue-level phenomena. We have tried to introduce many of these important resources throughout the book (e.g., the Brown, Switchboard, callhome, ATIS, TREC, MUC, and BNC corpora) and provide complete listings of many useful tagsets and coding schemes (such as the Penn Treebank, CLAWS C5 and C7, and the ARPAbet) but some inevitably got left out. Furthermore, rather than include references to URLs for many resources directly in the textbook, we have placed them on the book's Web site, where they can more readily updated. </p><p> The book is primarily intended for use in a graduate or advanced undergraduate course or sequence. Because of its comprehensive coverage and the large number of algorithms, the book is also useful as a reference for students and professionals in any of the areas of speech and language processing. Overview of the Book </p><p> The book is divided into four parts in addition to an introduction and end matter. Part I, "Words", introduces concepts related to the processing of words: phonetics, phonology, morphology, and algorithms used to process them: finite automata, finite transducers, weighted transducers, N-grams, and Hidden Markov Models. Part II, "Syntax", introduces parts-of-speech and phrase structure grammars for English and gives essential algorithms for processing word classes and structured relationships among words: part-of-speech taggers based on HMMs and transformation-based learning, the CYK and Earley algorithms for parsing, unification and typed feature structures, lexicalized and probabilistic parsing, and analytical tools like the Chomsky hierarchy and the pumping lemma. Part III, "Semantics", introduces first order predicate calculus and other ways of representing meaning, several approaches to compositional semantic analysis, along with applications to information retrieval, information extraction, speech understanding, and machine translation. Part IV, "Pragmatics", covers reference resolution and discourse structure and coherence, spoken dialogue phenomena like dialogue and speech act modeling, dialogue structure and coherence, and dialogue managers, as well as a comprehensive treatment of natural language generation and of machine translation.

Eliot, the father of the modern university, helped implement a policy that, in effect, barred graduates of Jesuit colleges from regular admission to Harvard Law School. The resulting controversy&#x2015;bitterly contentious and widely publicized&#x2015;was a defining moment in the history of American Catholic education, illuminating on whose terms and on what basis Catholics and Catholic colleges would participate in higher education in the twentieth century.</p><p>In <i>Catholic Higher Education in Protestant America</i>, Kathleen Mahoney considers the challenges faced by Catholics as the age of the university opened. She describes how liberal Protestant educators such as Eliot linked the modern university with the cause of a Protestant America and how Catholic students and educators variously resisted, accommodated, or embraced Protestant-inspired educational reforms. Drawing on social theories of cultural hegemony and insider-outsider roles, Mahoney traces the rise of the Law School controversy to the interplay of three powerful forces: the emergence of the liberal, nonsectarian research university; the development of a Catholic middle class whose aspirations included attendance at such institutions; and the Catholic church's increasingly strident campaign against modernism and, by extension, the intellectual foundations of modern academic life.</p></p><p><p><b>Kathleen A. Mahoney, </b> formerly an assistant professor of education at Boston College, is president of the Humanitas Foundation in New York City.</p><p>"A fascinating documentary on the struggles between 'descendants of Luther and the sons of Loyola'...

Murtaugh <i>Commonweal</i>)<br><br><p>"A fascinating story."</p> (Anthony J.

Eliot and the stoutly conservative American Jesuits.

She focuses on officers' wives, because they wrote about their experiences in letters, journals, and memoirs. Most of the women came from middle- or upper-class families and were trained to be proper Victorian ladies. On the frontier, they had to learn to live in primitive quarters and to make do with very limited resources. Their husbands were gone for extended periods of time, leaving them solely responsible for the family's welfare. They also had to deal with the violence of their isolated lifestyle and Indian raids. In the process, these women learned to be self-reliant and to step outside their traditional role. Eales's compelling study is highly recommended for general readers and students interested in Western military history.?Linda L.

While most books on kendo focus primarily on <i>kata,</i> or the traditional movements or forms, <i>The Shambhala Guide to Kendo </i> provides a succinct overview of the art as a whole: its historical significance, spiritual teachings, and how it can be used by practitioners today as a means of strengthening the body and mind. <br><br> <i>The Shambhala Guide to Kendo </i> (previously published in hardcover as <i>Kendo: Its Philosophy, History, and Means to Personal Growth </i> by Kegan Paul International, 1995), covers everything from the details of practice&#x2014;such as strikes, shouts, and stances&#x2014;to the history and philosophy of Japanese swordsmanship, including an overview of bushido, the code of the samurai. The author also demonstrates how the development of Buddhism influenced two important schools of Japanese swordsmanship. <br><br> <i>The Shambhala Guide to Kendo </i> includes discussions of: <br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Kendo as an expression of complete body-mind integration <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The historical development of kendo from the twelfth century to today <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The cultivation of the "mind of no-mind" in kendo, a state of egolessness and fearlessness <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The Buddhist "infrastructure" of kendo <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The practice of kendo meditation <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The significance of the dojo, or hall of practice<br> <i>The Shambhala Guide to Kendo </i> also provides a useful glossary that includes the Japanese and English rendering of key terms and an informative list of <i>ryu</i> (or school) lineages.

Scientists and pseudo scientists have been pursuing this mystery for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years. But now, astonishing new research is revealing patterns in human behavior previously thought to be purely random. Precise, orderly, predictable patterns...<br><br> Albert Laszlo Barabasi, already the world's preeminent researcher on the science of networks, describes his work on this profound mystery in <i>Bursts</i>, a stunningly original investigation into human nature. His approach relies on the digital reality of our world, from mobile phones to the Internet and email, because it has turned society into a huge research laboratory. All those electronic trails of time stamped texts, voicemails, and internet searches add up to a previously unavailable massive data set of statistics that track our movements, our decisions, our lives. Analysis of these trails is offering deep insights into the rhythm of how we do everything. His finding? We work and fight and play in short flourishes of activity followed by next to nothing. The pattern isn't random, it's "bursty." Randomness does not rule our lives in the way scientists have assumed up until now.<br><br> Illustrating this revolutionary science, Barabasi artfully weaves together the story of a 16th century burst of human activity-a bloody medieval crusade launched in his homeland, Transylvania-with the modern tale of a contemporary artist hunted by the FBI through our post 9/11 surveillance society. These narratives illustrate how predicting human behavior has long been the obsession, sometimes the duty, of those in power. Barab�si's astonishingly wide range of examples from seemingly unrelated areas include how dollar bills move around the U.S., the pattern everyone follows in writing email, the spread of epidemics, and even the flight patterns of albatross. In all these phenomena a virtually identical, mathematically described bursty pattern emerges.<br><br> <i>Bursts</i> reveals what this amazing new research is showing us about where individual spontaneity ends and predictability in human behavior begins. The way you think about your own potential to do something truly extraordinary will never be the same.<br><br></p><p>Albert-L�szl� Barab�si is a pioneer of real-world network theory and author of the bestseller, <i>Linked: How Everything is Connected to Everything Else and What It Means for Business, Science, and Everyday Life</i>. At 32, he was the youngest professor to be named the Emil T. Hofmann Professor of Physics at the University of Notre Dame and has won numerous awards for his work, including the FEBS Anniversary Prize for Systems Biology and the John von Neumann Medal for outstanding achievements. He currently lives in Boston and is Distinguished Professor and Director of the Center for Network Science at Northeastern University."In <i>Linked</i>, Barabasi showed us how complex networks unfold in space. In <i>Bursts</i>, he shows us how they unfold in time. Your life may look random to you, but everything from your visits to a web page to your visits to the doctor are predictable, and happen in bursts."<br> -Clay Shirky, author of <i>Here Comes Everybody</i><br><br> "Barabasi is one of the few people in the world who understand the deep structure of empirical reality."<br> -Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of <i>The Black Swan</i><br><br> "Barab�si brings a physicist's penetrating eye to a sweeping range of human activities, from migration to web browsing, from wars to billionaires, from illnesses to letter writing, from the Department of Homeland Security to the Conclave of Cardinals. Barab�si shows how a pattern of bursts appears in what has long seemed a random mess. These bursts are both mathematically predictable and beautiful. What a joy it is to read him. You feel like you have emerged to see a new vista that, while it had always been there, you had just never seen."<br> -Nicholas A. Christakis, M.D., Ph.D., coauthor of <i>Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives</i><br><br> "<i>Bursts</i> is a rich, rewarding read that illuminates a cutting-edge topic: the patterns of human mobility in an era of total surveillance. The narrative structure of Barab�si's provocative book mimics the very pattern of bursts, as abrupt jumps through the lives of a post-modern sculptor, a medieval Hungarian revolutionist, and Albert Einstein eventually converge on a single theme: that our unthinking behaviors are governed by a deeper meaning that can only be deciphered through the brave lens of mathematics."<br> -Ogi Ogas, Ph.D., and Sai Gaddam, Ph.D., Boston University<br><br> "Barbasi, a distinguished scientist of complex networks, bravely tests his innovative theories on some historic events, including a sixteenth-century Crusade that went terribly wrong. Whether or not the concept of "burstiness" is the key to unlocking human behavior, it is nonetheless a fascinating new way to think about some very old questions." <br> -Thomas F.

After eight months of terrible fighting, they would fail. Turkey regards the victory to this day as a defining moment in its history, a heroic last stand in the defense of the nation&#x2019;s Ottoman Empire. But, counter-intuitively, it would signify something perhaps even greater for the defeated Australians and New Zealanders involved: the birth of their countries&#x2019; sense of nationhood. Now approaching its centenary, the Gallipoli campaign, commemorated each year on Anzac Day, reverberates with importance as the origin and symbol of Australian and New Zealand identity. As such, the facts of the battle&#x2014;which was minor against the scale of World War I and cost less than a sixth of the Australian deaths on the Western Front&#x2014;are often forgotten or obscured.

She and Michael Scott live on Orcas Island, WA. Joyce Goldstein is author of The Mediterranean Kitchen. She lives in San Francisco.Over the past 25 years, Orchid's intimate restaurant, Christina's, situated over a refurbished gas station on Orcas Island north of Seattle, has developed a local cult following as well as become a pilgrimage destination for foodies. With her first book, Orchid shares the robust approach to American cooking that has won her so many fans. Bringing together her grandparents' ranch traditions, basic French and Italian techniques and the Northwest's abundant local ingredients, she has produced an appealing volume that showcases both her skill and her down-to-earth philosophy. Orchid's impeccably clear and simple recipes are organized around the parts of the meal&#x2014;appetizers, salads, main courses, etc.&#x2014;interspersed with essays on ingredients (tomatoes, salmon) and objects (tools). There are familiar dishes, such as Planked Salmon, but also a happy abundance of more idiosyncratic Orchid twists, including her signature chutneys and breadsticks, as well as dishes like Cold Halibut Ceviche Soup, Grilled Sturgeon with Blueberry Chutney, and Pomegranate Lamb Chops. Those living outside the Northwest may find certain ingredients hard to find (e.g., Ling cod, sockeye and Dungeness crab), but Orchid's fondness for pairing strong natural flavorings is within the reach of most dedicated home cooks.

This act and his very presence precipitate a series of hijinx on the part of the residents. The characters are all given amusing ways of talking, and many have a secret agenda in their interactions, but the main point of the story is to provide or provoke a comic perspective on race and slavery, ending in a resolution that literally comes out of a machine. The exaggerated characters border on offensive, with attitudes that would be easier to classify if the story or artwork, and not the cover flap, informed readers that the action takes place in the 19th century&#x2013;a claim undercut by relentlessly anachronistic dialogue and situations. The artwork is clever, with marvelous colors and elegantly rendered backgrounds, but the characters have been reduced to an objectified simplicity that makes them difficult to read. Additionally, visual sequences are frequently interrupted by sudden vignettes, either of a flashback or a metaphor rendered literally. These seem to exist in order to inject an additional dose of comedy into the proceedings while breaking up lengthy expository narratives. What they serve to do, however, is jar readers and further fracture the reading experience.<i>&#x2013;Benjamin Russell, Belmont High School, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Slightly later, he also started collecting for the Society but despite years of work collecting, labeling and packing plants and organizing a team of Chinese artists until he left China in 1831, Reeves never enjoyed the same degree of recognition as other naturalists in China.<br><br>This was possibly because he had a demanding job as a tea inspector. Reeves himself never claimed to be a professional naturalist and the plant collecting and painting supervision were undertaken in his own time. Furthermore, fan qui (foreign devils) were restricted to the port area of Canton and to Macau, so that plant-hunting expeditions further afield were impossible. Furthermore, Reeves never published an account of his life in the country, unlike Clarke Abel and Robert Fortune, but he left us some letters, notebooks, drawings and maps.<br><br>The Collection is held at the Royal Horticultural Society's Lindley Library in Vincent Square, London. It is a magnificent achievement. Not only are the pictures accurate and richly colored plant portraits of plants then unknown in the West, but they stand as a record of plants being cultivated in nineteenth-century Canton and Macau. In John Reeves: Pioneering Collector of Chinese Plants and Botanical Art, Kate Bailey reveals John Reeves' life as an East India Company tea inspector in nineteenth-century China and shows how he managed to collect and document thousands of Chinese natural history drawings, far more than anyone else at the time.</p><p>Kate Bailey started working life as a reluctant solicitor. At the age of 54, on the strength of nothing more than a magazine article about a paper conservator, she abandoned the law and enrolled at Camberwell College of Arts for a degree in paper conservation. After obtaining an M.A., and being accepted for a PH.D., for three years Kate stalked Reeves in libraries, museums and auction houses while at the same time drawing on her own childhood memories of Singapore and Hong Kong in the early 1950s. A post-doctoral year at the V&amp;A followed, working on a collaborative project into the pigments found on Chinese export paintings using the Reeves pictures for comparison. Then came a request for a book to bring the work of a modest, dedicated East India Company tea inspector and his band of skilful Chinese painters to a wider audience. Kate continues to research, write and lecture on Reeves and related art-botanical subjects.</p><h2>Fabric Dyeing For Beginners</h2><p>For the many people who love hand-dyed fabrics but think they are too difficult to make, Vimala McClure presents an easy to do technique that is convenient and gentle on the pocketbook. The author says, &#39;I use methods that are simple to understand and that can be broken down into steps to be completed on separate days.&#39; Because her dyeing process is done in small batches, there is minimal mess to clean up. Worked in small jars or a plastic bin, luminous fabrics with exciting patterns can be made in a total of two to three hours. Using widely available dye products, which are listed in the resources section, the author provides dye recipes for mixing batches of 12 different colors or, for more variety, 24 colors. She shows how to make intriguing color mixtures, single-color gradations and multiple color gradations. With a cookbook approach and step by step photos, the author demonstrates tie dyeing, Shibori-like dyeing, fold dyeing, and overdyeing, each method illustrated with examples of wonderful fabric swatches and quilt blocks. She also describes how to make simple stencils for sponging or spraying to add pizzazz to any fabric.</p><p>&#34;Quilting gave me a creative outlet when I was raising my children. Each quilt I made fueled my creative fire. Soon I was making 3 and 4 quilts at a time.&#34; Today Vimala McClure writes and inspires creativity. It is her mission to promote creative quiltmaking.McClure approaches the somewhat daunting prospect of chemicals, rubber gloves, and stained sinks wi th enthusiasm, but also with practical sense. She knows that busy women need ways to fit these processes into their other responsibilities, and so breaks the processes up into small, manageable pieces that can be done over several days...The technical details are nicely balanced by photos of many styles of quilts that make use of hand=dyed fabrics.- Planet Patchwork Brookbriefs No. 20</p><h2>Transformers Classics UK Volume 1</h2><p><ul> <li>Classic <i>Transformers</i> tales from the UK continuity begins here!

For example, if you have been trying to lose weight and get in shape for years, should you hire a trainer to push yourself to try harder, or will you keep failing until you understand more about your own internal resistance? Trying harder is the "All-American" approach. Whether it's dating, dieting, or dealing with a job crisis, we like to believe that we can change just about anything if we are only willing to work hard enough. Not trying so hard is counter-intuitive; it may even seem like laziness or a lack of will power to stop trying so hard. Nonetheless, there are times when trying harder is the definition of insanity; doing the same thing over and over again and expecting something different to happen. So how does one know when it is better to try harder or when to stop trying so hard? Extensive psychological research makes it clear that neither of these approaches used alone is as effective as learning how to integrate the two together. Action without insight frequently leads to disappointment. <i>Change Happens</i> successfully articulates common experiences that we rarely put into words, shows how the process of change looks in the lives of real people, and gives examples and illustrations of different kinds of situations to help readers identify and apply the insight to their own lives. Weiss brings together some of the most compelling contemporary psychological thinking on the process of change and shows how these insights play out and help transform the lives of real people.</p><p><b>Avrum Geurin Weiss</b> has been a therapist and teacher-of-therapists for over 30 years and holds an adjunct faculty position in the department of Psychology at Georgia State University. He is the director of the Pine River Psychotherapy Training Institute.In a sea of self-help books, Avrum Geurin Weiss, PhD, has written a gem with a message you don&#x2019;t often hear. Change Happens: When to Try Harder and When to Stop Trying So Hard will be a relief to those who think, &#x201c;If I want to lose weight or improve my marriage or stop smoking, I have to try hard, and if it&#x2019;s not happening, I just have to try harder and I&#x2019;ll succeed.&#x201d; Most self-help books turn<br>on exactly this advice. But, Weiss says, that approach often backfires. &#x201c;As a culture, we are obsessed with change,&#x201d; yet &#x201c;we are not very reflective about the process of change.&#x201d; In fact, Weiss explains, people have a hard time taking responsibility for change, even though they desperately seek it....Weiss, a therapist, adjunct faculty member of Georgia State University&#x2019;s psychology department, and director of the Pine River Psychotherapy Training Institute, proposes that we evaluate different kinds of change (external, internal), then learn when to double our efforts&#x2014;and when to ease up. Weiss packs his narrative with real-life examples of people doing one or the other. You may see yourself&#x2014;and the change you want to make&#x2014;within the pages of this smart, insightful book.

Conventional wisdom blames Wall Street and the mortgage industry for using low down pay�ments, teaser rates, and other predatory tactics to seduce unsuspecting home owners into assuming mortgages they couldn&#39;t afford. It blames average Americans for borrowing recklessly and spend�ing too much. And it blames the tax policies and deregulatory environment of the Reagan and Bush administrations for encouraging reckless risk taking by wealthy individuals and financial institutions. But according to Unintended Consequences, the conventional wisdom masks the real causes of our economic disruption and puts us at risk of facing a slew of unintended-and potentially dangerous-consequences.</p><p><p><b>Edward "Ed" Conard</b> is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> top-ten bestselling book, <i>Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You've Been Told About the Economy Is Wrong</i> (2012).

At the same time, it provides an astonishing background history to more than a century of Irish domestic discord, including Gladstone's failed Home Rule Acts of the late nineteenth century, the partition of Ireland, the horror of the Troubles, and the establishment of the brittle Good Friday Agreement, in which, amid accusations of sectarian bias, the RUC was generally recognized as an impediment to reconciliation and began its transformation into the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p><p><b>Chris Ryder</b> is a writer and journalist who was the Northern Ireland correspondent for the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and was previously on the staff of the <i>Sunday Times</i>.</p><h2>The Associated Press Style Book And Libel Manual: With Appendixes On Photo Captions, Filing The Wire</h2><p>Reduced price due to minimal shelf wear.

Some communities were so caught up in the frenzy that they changed their liturgy to reflect what they believed to be in the impending declaration of the messianic age. In September of 1666, Zevi was granted an audience with the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, but things did not turn out as Zevi had envisioned. He was given a choice between conversion to Islam or death. Zevi chose the former. Sabbatai Zevi now proclaimed himself as the hidden messiah of Israel. Some of his most devoted followers converted as well, but his conversion ended the legitimacy of his messianic claims for most of his followers.As momentous as the Sabbatean movement was, what most people are unfamiliar with is the fact that many of Zevi&#x2019;s most active supporters were from Spanish and Portuguese Jewish backgrounds. More specifically, they were from Converso backgrounds. Conversos were the descendants of Iberian Jews who had converted to Christianity in the late 14th and through the end of the 15th centuries in the Iberian Peninsula. The Conversos who supported Zevi were often first-generation returnees to Judaism. That is, they had lived in the Iberian Peninsula as Christians and returned to Judaism within their lifetime. This book examines what attracted former Conversos to the movement and the extent of their involvement.</p><p></p><h2>A Study of Communism</h2><p>Written at the height of the Cold War, here is the book review from the Kirkus Review, October 1, 1962: &#34;A sequel to Masters of (1958) again blueprints and briefs the average reader on the aims and methods of Communism. It also returns to the economic, sociological, political and psychological origins of the movement and its attractions, returning in particular to Karl Marx and the writing of Das Kapital and concluding that Communists are &#34;&#34;false prophets&#34;&#34;. Their method is error and their views are distorted. Parallels are drawn between Lenin&#39;s adaptation of the Marxist movement and the American Revolution. In later chapters Hoover traces the perversion of the ideology in the hands of the Russians, the power struggle that followed, the attempts to communize the U.S. since Stalin&#39;s rise and fall, and how nationalism has thwarted Communism. How the Communist Party operates in the United States, and how Communism and Free World structures differ on such basic points as law, economy, education, elections, etc. also form basic parts of the book. Hoover&#39;s historical information is correct though overfly simplified, and his conclusions seem to follow much thinking in this country today. It is a book dispassionately written, designed not to dis-color, but to bring the reader awareness of a broad and important area of political facts. As such it succeeds, although in some of the dichotomies between the Red and Free Worlds, it tends to make too many black and white distinctions. The head of the F.B.I. carries weight in many circles and speaks with special authority.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Beyond the Bath</h2><p>Shows imaginative designs for bathrooms and the showers, bathtubs, sinks, fixtures, and accessories which can be used to decorate them</p><p></p><h2>The Tiananmen Square Massacre (Cornerstones of Freedom: Third Series) (Library Edition)</h2><p><b>Learn about the events that made America what she is today.</b><br><br>Following the death of Mao Zedong, China experienced rapid political and economic reform throughout the late 1970s and 1980s.

Mermaids sing in the murky harbor, desert spirits crowd the night, and dreams are more real than waking.<br><br>Charles de Lint began his chronicles of the extraordinary city of Newford in <i>Memory &amp; Dream</i> and the short-story collection <i>Dreams Underfoot</i>. In <i>The Ivory and the Horn,</i> this uncommonly gifted craftsman weaves a new tapestry of stark realism and fond hope, mean streets and boulevards of dreams, where you will rediscover the power of love and longing, of wishes and desires, and of the magic that hovers at the edge of everyday life.<br></p><p>Born in Holland in 1951, Charles de Lint grew up in Canada, with a few years off in Turkey, Lebanon, and Switzerland. <br><br>Although his first novel was 1984's <i>The Riddle of the Wren</i>, it was with<i> Moonheart</i>, published later that same year, that de Lint made his mark, and established him at the forefront of "urban fantasy," modern fantasy storytelling set on contemporary city streets. <i> Moonheart </i>was set in and around "Newford," an imaginary modern North American city, and many of de Lint's subsequent novels have been set in Newford as well, with a growing cast of characters who weave their way in and out of the stories. The Newford novels include<i> Spirit Walk, Memory and Dream, Trader, Someplace To Be Flying, Forests of the Heart, The Onion Girl, </i>and<i> Spirits in the Wires</i>. In addition, de Lint has published several collections of Newford short stories, including <i>Moonlight and Vines</i>, for which he won the World Fantasy Award. Among de Lint's many other novels are <i>Mulengro, Jack the Giant-Killer, </i>and<i> The Little Country</i>.<br><br>Married since 1980 to his fellow musician MaryAnn Harris, Charles de Lint lives in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. <br>This fanciful and moving collection of 15 tales, some loosely related with common characters, probes deeply into the nature of art and artists and the souls of the poor and downtrodden. In the fictional city of Newford, a touch of enchantment can bring surcease from pain and lead to deeper self-knowledge. In "Mr. Truepenny's Book Emporium and Gallery," a lonely young girl called Sophie daydreams about a wonderful shop, only to find, years later, that it has its own reality. Sophie, now an adult and an artist, finds herself marooned in another dream world, a Native American one, in "Where Desert Spirits Crowd the Night." And "In Dream Harder, Dream True," an ordinary young man rescues a woman with a broken wing, maybe a fairy, maybe an angel; they become Sophie's parents before the woman disappears. "Bird Bones and Wood Ash" deals with monsters who prey on their children and gives a woman tools to destroy them and save their victims. In "Waifs and Strays," a young woman, little more than a stray herself, who saves abandoned dogs and other neglected creatures, helps the ghost of her first benefactor find peace and move on. De Lint's evocative images, both ordinary and fantastic, jolt the imagination. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Quiet Strength: The Faith, the Hope, and the Heart of a Woman Who Changed a Nation</h2><p>The author shares her thoughts about her life, faith, and values</p><p>On June 15, 1999, Mrs. Rosa Parks was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor -- a tribute to the power of one solitary woman to influence the soul of a nation. But awards and influence were far from her mind when, on December 1, 1955, she refused to move to the back of a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. She was not trying to start a movement. She was simply tired of social injustice and did not think a woman should be forced to stand so that a man could sit down. Yet her simple act of courage set in motion a chain of events that changed forever the landscape of American race relations. Quiet Strength celebrates the principles and convictions that have guided her through a remarkable life. It is a printed record of her legacy -- her lasting message to a world still struggling to live in harmony.The late Rosa Parks was co-founder of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development and is recognized as the &#39;mother of the modern-day civil rights movement.&#39;</p><h2>Anatomy of the Fourth Gospel</h2><p>Hardcover with dust jacket.

Victor J. Stenger gives a provocative, often amusing history of psychic research and occult beliefs, offering a convincing rebuttal to those who attempt to link physics to mystical truths. Stenger examines a number of well-known paranormal claims and shows how they can be explained without resorting to supernatural or psychic hypotheses. Discussing quantum theory and relativity, he demonstrates that these concepts actually invalidate paranormal claims and that there is no scientific basis for a universe other than one composed of observable matter.</p><p><b>Victor J. Stenger</b>&nbsp;(1935 - 2014) was an adjunct professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado and emeritus professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Hawaii. He was the author of the<i>&nbsp;New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestseller&nbsp;<i>God: The Failed Hypothesis, God and the Atom, God and the Folly of Faith</i>,<i>&nbsp;The Comprehensible Cosmos</i>, and many other books.A particle physicist at the University of Hawaii, Stenger sets forth a purely materialist, reductionist view of the universe. The transcendent--gods, spirits, religious or mystical experiences--is delusory, in his reckoning. He further maintains that paranormal phenomena such as precognition or mind-over-matter are due to fraud, hallucination, error or a will to believe. Whether he is discussing ESP, poltergeists, UFOs, or out-of-body or near-death experiences, he ignores, misrepresents or skims over evidence that would contradict his thesis, while maintaining an aura of detached objectivity. Claiming that religious or supernatural beliefs may be programmed into our DNA because they once had survival value, Stenger rejects the holism of New Age Thinkers and physicists, disputing their claim that instantaneous connections link events across space and time. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Classical Papers of Gilbert Highet</h2><p>Format Hardcover Subject Ancient Greek Literature Literary Criticism Ancient Roman Literature Literary Criticism Publisher Columbia University Press</p><p></p><h2>Too Hurt to Stay: The True Story of a Troubled Boy&#x2019;s Desperate Search for a Loving Home</h2><p><p>The fourth title from Sunday Times bestselling author Casey Watson.</p><p>Eight-year-old Spencer takes himself to social services and demands to be taken into care.

Maps make the complex simple, and reveal the complexity behind the apparently simple. <em>Mapping It Out</em> invites artists, architects, writers, and designers, geographers, mathematicians, computer pioneers, scientists, and others from a host of fields to create a personal map of their own, in whatever form and showing whatever terrain they choose, whether real-world or imaginary.<br><br> Over 130 contributors&#x2019; ideas are represented, including Yoko Ono, Louise Bourgeois, Damien Hirst, David Adjaye, Ed Ruscha, Alexander Kluge, and many more. Some contributors have translated scientific data into simplified visual language, while others have condensed vast social, political, or natural forms into concise diagrams. There are reworked existing maps, alternate views of reality, charted imaginary flights of fancy, and the occasional rejection of a traditional map altogether. 140 illustrations, 120 in color</p><p><p><strong>Hans Ulrich Obrist</strong> is an art historian and Director of International Projects at the Serpentine Gallery.</p><p><strong>Tom McCarthy</strong> is a writer and artist.

All pages are clean, bright and intact. Binding is tight. SHIPS NEXT BUSINESS DAY!</p><p>The Quilter's Album of Blocks &amp; Borders is the most comprehensive, most usable collection of patchwork designs ever assembled. Each of the over 750 geometric designs, illustrated and categorized for easy identification and drafting, is drawn in clear, artistic detail, and there are scores of tips for innovative uses of fabric, many of which are graphically demonstrated. In this book, patterns are not only indexed by their various names but also organized according to their type of design. The categorization, such as fourpatch or seven-patch or hexagonal, is the revolutionary system that Mrs. Beyer set out in her first and instantly popular book, Patchwork Patterns. In this companion volume, she has compiled and categorized more than 1,000 quilt names. And she has included a handy seethrough plastic insert printed with a grid of each of the eight categories. By laying this grid sheet over the drawing of a block, you can easily match block to grid and thus see how to draft it. With this book Jinny Beyer becomes the first author to pay more than glancing attention to border designs; there are 145 included here. She also reveals the secrets of her own innovative and subtle use of fabrics, the hallmark of her prize-winning work. Her clear explanations and ingenious illustrations can teach more about combining fabrics than years of formal classes. In her effort to make her Album as comprehensive as it is well organized, Mrs. Beyer spent countless hours searching for the oldest published source for each pattern. Her sense of debt to generations of quiltmakers who have gone before &#x2013; usually unnamed and unsung &#x2013; is so deeply felt that she has dedicated this book to them. A truly useful dictionary, a pioneer attempt to document historical patterns, a survey of border designs plus an exciting short course on the effective use of fabrics -- all these contributions make The Quilter's Album of Blocks &amp; Borders a must for anyone who creates with geometric design.</p><h2>Eastern Point: A Nautical, Rustical and More or Less Sociable Chronicle of Gloucester&#39;s Outer Shield and Inner Sanctum, 1606-1990</h2><p>A social history of Eastern Point, written by Gloucester native Joe Garland.</p><p>Joseph E.

Most Christmas stories are Santa Clausy and seem rather sterile to me. In order to make it into one of my Christmas collections, a story must be Christ-centered in terms of values, and it must speak to my heart, move me deeply, force me to reach for my Kleenex box. It is this heart-tugging quotient, I submit, that has kept this series alive for eight years now.Stories in this book include: The Beloved House, Christmas in the Heart, A Pint of Judgment, Special Delivery, plus 10 more.</p><p>No season beats Christmas for being sentimental. Somehow all things converge to make it a season for giving, caring, and sharing, especially with family. Undeniably, the stories we share make us inseparable from our families. Some stories become everyone's story by capturing the essence of Christmas.

After composing his first story, he began recalling those his mother used to tell each year, and finding others, old and new. Years later, he now shares with us the best of his timeless treasury of heartwarming classics from the golden age of Christmas stories. Well-known authors such as Pearl S.

Published by his estate and introduced by his widow, his entries have been tailored to a memoir of his life from 1946 to 1963. These are the years of his rise to stardom in music and movies--and his tumble into the trenches of incarceration and drug abuse. The book is divided into 13 quick-reading chapters in which Baker writes of his life as a musician, all seasoned with tales of drugs, prison terms, and a laundry list of romances. Often, though, his writings are not spicy enough; births, deaths, pregnancies, and car chases are noted without much detail. What must have been extremely charged times are written about with a kind of academic disinterest: &#34;Moving quickly toward the noise, as did everyone else, I saw Dick lying on the floor. He had passed out cold, and several people were trying to figure out what was wrong with him. We located a doctor and cleared the stage area. I should point out that Dick had always taken care of business; always at work on time and always playing exceptionally.&#34; While some readers may be disappointed by the lack of layered passion one hears in Baker&#39;s voice or in the smooth and solid sound of his horn, there is still considerable value in reading his own account of his story."Only a handful of autobiographies have truly represented the rigors of jazz life. Add to [this] short list <i>As Though I Had Wings</i>." --<i>The Los Angeles Times</i><p> "This is a sad, sweet book that reads like one of Chet Baker's trumpet solos...His memories show the same eye for hedonistic detail that he had in his music." --<i>The Seattle Times</i></p><p> "<i>As Though I Had Wings</i> captures dead-on the trumpeter's legendary melancholy." --<i>Independent Weekly</i></p><p> "One of the finest soloists jazz has produced...At every step in both his music and his life Chet Baker went his own way." --Ted Gioia, <i>West Coast Jazz</i></p><p> "This poignant remembrance...captures West Coast jazz in the fifties...Unforgettable." --Timothy White, Editor in Chief of <i>Billboard</i></p></p><h2>From Society to Socialism: The Art of Caroline Durieux</h2><p>56 page exhibition catalogue.

That the memoir is true makes it hard to put down or to forget. When convinced that the secret police were going to arrange an &#x201c;accident&#x201d; to kill his friend, the missionary decided he had no choice but to help well known human rights leader Peng Ming-min escape from Taiwan. So successful was the getaway that when President Richard Nixon and Chinese Premier Chou En-lai met in Beijing two years later and wanted to know how Peng got out, neither of their vast intelligence systems could tell them. Even Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, who presided over Taiwan&#x2019;s Stalinist-style police state, went to his grave without knowing that a group of non-government novices managed to get Peng out undetected.</p> <p>Milo Thornberry believed God called him to be a missionary to teach history and live the faith he professed. Taiwan wasn&#x2019;t his choice, but it was where the Methodist Church sent him at the end of 1965. "Fireproof Moth: A Missionary in Taiwan&#x2019;s White Terror" is a 65,000-word account of how becoming friends with Peng led to a double life, one in which Milo taught church history at Presbyterian seminaries, and the other in which he and his wife secretly collaborated with Peng and two of his former students in a variety of human rights activities, all of which were illegal and some of which were considered capital crimes under martial law. The constant threat of discovery by Chiang&#x2019;s secret police gave Milo his own taste of the White Terror. When police showed up at their door on March 3, 1971, Milo and his wife became the first missionaries arrested since the Nationalists took over the island in 1945. Although the Kuomintang leaked a panoply of charges to explain the arrest and deportation, Peng&#x2019;s escape and the Thornberry&#x2019;s other activities were not among them. Instead, officials in Taiwan reported them as terrorists. The line in Beijing was that they were CIA agents.</p> <p>Although Thornberry did not suffer torture and imprisonment like Wei Ting-chao and Hsieh Tsung-min, nor Peng&#x2019;s twenty-year exile from his homeland, Milo was blacklisted by the U.S. State Department and denied a passport for nineteen years. Not allowed to resume his vocation as a missionary outside the United States, he completed his doctorate at Boston University, trained missionaries, and served as a pastor in Alaska and Oregon. His role in Peng&#x2019;s escape was not revealed until 2003 when Milo was invited back to the newly democratic Taiwan to be recognized for his human rights activities. Only in 2009 did he and Peng uncover the true reason for Milo&#x2019;s arrest thirty-eight years earlier. As a personal story, Milo&#x2019;s conflicts of conscience between ideals of justice, breaking the law, and being a guest in the country were not theoretical questions, but the daily cauldron in which he made his fateful decisions. As a political narrative, the author&#x2019;s portrayal of life in the White Terror casts an eerie shadow on contemporary relations between the United States, China, and Taiwan.</p></p><p></p><h2>George MacDonald</h2><p>Traces the life of the 19th century Scottish writer, co surveys the development influence on modern literature</p><p></p><h2>The 1000 BHP Grand Prix cars (A Foulis motoring book)</h2><p>Complete detailed descriptions of the 1983-1986 Grand Prix engines from Renault, BMW, Porsche-TAG, Zakspeed, Hart, Cosworth-Ford, Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Motori Moderni, and Honda.</p><p></p><h2>English A Portrait Of A People</h2><p>A highly collectible tight clean copy inscribed by the author, protected in a new brodart wrapper, no inscriptions, unclipped dustjacket, this is not an Ex-Lib or a BCE/BOMC edition.</p><p>What is it about the English? Not the British overall, not the Scots, not the Irish or the Welsh, but the English. Why do they seem so unsure of who they are? As Jeremy Paxman remarks in his preface to <i>The English</i>, being English "used to be so easy". Now, with the Empire gone, with Wales and Scotland moving into more independent postures, with the troubling specter of a united Europe (and despite the raucous hype of "Cool Britannia"), the English seem to have entered a collective crisis of national identity.<p> Jeremy Paxman has set himself the task of finding just what exactly is going on. Why, he wonders, "do the English seem to enjoy feeling so persecuted? What is behind the English obsession with games? How did they acquire their odd attitudes to sex and food? Where did they get their extraordinary capacity for hypocrisy?" He ranges widely in pursuit of answers, sifting through literature, cinema, and history. It is an intriguing investigation, encompassing many aspects of national life and character (such as it is), including the obligatory visit to that baffling phenomenon, the funeral of Princess Diana. Yet Paxman finds something fresh and interesting to say about even that now rather threadbare topic. In the end, he seems to find further questions to ask instead of answers. But why not? To him it is a sign that the English are acquiring a new sense of self. And some indication of this might lie in the obvious response to his remark that the English, being top of the British Imperial tree, had nicknames for their fellow nationalities--Jock, Taffy, Paddy, and Mick--but there was no corresponding name for an Englishman. Of course, there is one now, and it comes from one of the bits of empire to which so many undesirables were exported: Whinging Pom. <i>--Robin Davidson, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Jeremy Paxman grew up thinking of himself as &#34;English,&#34; despite being one quarter Scottish.

We&#x2019;ll talk in the truck.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do that.&#x201d;<br>We finished our sodas and chucked the cans into the open manhole. They made no sound.<br>&#x201c;Hey, Chow, can you get that cover back on?&#x201d; Vandyne asked.<br>&#x201c;Why me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because you&#x2019;re good at it and I have seniority.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is this in my job description?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just remember one thing, partner. You signed yourself up for these assignments. You wanted it.&#x201d;<br>I folded up the orange gate that had blocked off traffic and put it in the truck. Then I grabbed a crowbar and dragged the manhole cover back on. The late-summer sun reflected off a windshield directly into my eyes and I had to keep my head down.<br>I threw the crowbar into the back of the truck and slammed the door shut. Vandyne started up the engine before I jumped in on the passenger side. I reached over and cranked up the AC.<br>&#x201c;That starts blowing cool pretty quick,&#x201d; said Vandyne. We wound our windows up.<br>&#x201c;There were people down there,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Maybe like a week ago, judging by the footprints and other garbage.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. Probably twenty people.&#x201d;<br>We both had field experience in Vietnam. Even though we had been back to the World for four years, our memories were still fresh. Too fresh.<br>&#x201c;But no shells, no bodies, no blood,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;The tourists said they heard gunshots and yelling coming from the gutter.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Maybe it was kids who were lighting up firecrackers and dropping them down there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Personally,&#x201d; said Vandyne slowly, &#x201c;the worst thing I saw down there was all the congealed grease lying around. Made me think about fat clogging arteries.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All those Chinatown restaurants have to pour their crap out somewhere. Why not down the gutter? It&#x2019;s right there and you don&#x2019;t even have to pay someone to dispose of it.&#x201d;<br>There was a loud honking behind us. A noodle truck didn&#x2019;t have enough room to squeeze by. The guy in the passenger seat stuck his head out and saw in my side mirror that I was Chinese. He jumped out and charged up to my window.<br>I cranked the window down so he could yell at me.<br>&#x201c;You guys are the worst!&#x201d; he started. &#x201c;Lazy! Stupid! Greedy! You keep raising your rates and now you want to take over the streets, too! Get out of my way, already, or is the black boy too stupid to know how to drive?&#x201d;<br>I looked down at my reflective orange vest and my Con Ed patch. I pushed back my hard hat and said, &#x201c;Eat shit, fuckface.&#x201d;<br>Vandyne eased the truck away from the curb. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; he asked me.<br>&#x201c;He lost his cat. I told him where to find it.&#x201d;<br>Vandyne smirked.<br>We went through a police checkpoint before getting onto the Brooklyn Bridge. A cop came up to the window. He looked in at both of us, nodded, and waved us through.<br>I leaned back in the passenger&#x2019;s seat and turned to Vandyne.<br>&#x201c;I never thought New York would see so much terrorism,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;Me and you both.&#x201d;<br>The latest bombing by the group FALN, which sought in de pendence for Puerto Rico from the United States, had blown up a phone booth outside of 1 Police Plaza. Two people were lightly injured, but the indignity of having a bomb go off right under our headquarters lit a fire under the ass of the NYPD in general and the Fifth Precinct in particular, because it happened inside our boundaries. All precinct detectives were dispatched full-time on destroying the FALN except for Vandyne, who was the least se nior detective, and me, because I was only on detective track. Unlike Vandyne, I didn&#x2019;t have the gold shield yet. I was Encyclopedia Brown with a gun.<br>&#x201c;Terrorists only harm their own causes and shame their own people,&#x201d; said Vandyne.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get those sons of bitches,&#x201d; I said.<br>I picked up the Chinese papers from the floor.<br>The Communist-biased newspaper had an editorial about how U.S. Representatives John Young, Wayne Hays, and Allan T. Howe&#x2014;all recently embroiled in separate sex scandals&#x2014;were emblematic of a corrupt capitalist society ready to collapse shortly after turning two hundred years old.<br>The Hong Kong&#x2013;biased newspaper congratulated Trinidad and Tobago on gaining in de pen dence and joining the Commonwealth.<br>&#x201c;Anything good?&#x201d; asked Vandyne.<br>&#x201c;Naw,&#x201d; I said. I put an eight-track of Innervisions into the player.<br>&#x201c;Normally, I don&#x2019;t like synthesizers,&#x201d; Vandyne said. &#x201c;But this is all right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This is what Stevie hears in his head,&#x201d; I said.<br>For a year, from 1974 to 1975, Vandyne and I were partnered in a sector car for the Fifth Precinct. I could not have asked to be paired up with a better person&#x2014;a fellow Vietnam vet and someone else who had also killed a little boy there.<br>Then right before the layoffs and cutbacks from the city&#x2019;s financial crisis kicked in, we lost our car. Vandyne picked up investigative assignments while they had stuck me on a footpost.<br>They also made me attend community functions in Chinatown so when the pictures came out in the Chinese newspapers there was me in a uniform saying, &#x201c;See, the NYPD actually hired one of you people!&#x201d; They were putting the one Chinese cop they had in the most visible position possible.<br>Sitting at these dinner events depressed me even more because as much as the NYPD was using me to establish legitimacy with the Chinese, the various community leaders were using me to boost their own profiles in Chinatown.<br>I drank until I forgot everything: frustrations with the job, jealousy that Vandyne was getting ahead, Nam flashbacks. But when I woke up and remembered again, it was always worse.<br>That was all behind me now, but I still shuddered when I thought about those days.<br>I folded up the Chinese newspapers and shoved them into my right armpit.<br>We showered in the Con Ed employee facilities.<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe how clean this place is,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They give you clean towels, soap, and shampoo.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re in the wrong line of work, partner,&#x201d; said Vandyne.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like a country club.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This is no country club! I bused tables at a country club one summer outside Philly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What was it like working for the man?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, the worst tippers were the Chinese people.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Chinese people don&#x2019;t join country clubs!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I think one of them was named &#x2018;Robert Chow.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>&#x201c;See, there you go. &#x2018;Robert Chow&#x2019; is not a Chinese name.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s an American name.&#x201d;<br>We got back into our street clothes. Vandyne dressed in khakis, a dark blue buttoned shirt, and a Mets hat. I had on a pair of jeans and a rugby-styled shirt that my girlfriend had paid way too much money for.<br>We went into the underground parking and got into the unmarked car.<br>&#x201c;So very recently there were about twenty people down there,&#x201d; I started.<br>&#x201c;The information we got was good.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The information was old. Where are those people now?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The smugglers must have moved them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;One other possibility,&#x201d; I suggested, &#x201c;is that those people could have settled their debts all at once and been released. But that&#x2019;s not a likely scenario.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What else could have happened?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The only possibilities are that they paid up, were moved, or were killed.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, they weren&#x2019;t killed. I don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;ve paid up. So where have they been moved to?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s today&#x2019;s bonus question.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;These people who get smuggled in, what keeps them going to work and coming home to the safe house?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Chinese people freak out about settling debts. It&#x2019;s shameful to have one, no matter how evil the lender is. Besides, if they tried to run away, they&#x2019;d probably be killed.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How much is the smuggling fee?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Several thousand dollars.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Several thousand!&#x201d; exclaimed Vandyne. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lot of money to just see the Statue of Liberty.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You have to give it to the illegals, they&#x2019;re the huddled masses.

Fields, forests, orchards, and prairies are the result of repeated campaigns by amateurs, tradesmen, and scientists to introduce desirable plants, both American and foreign, while preventing growth of alien riff-raff. These horticulturists coaxed plants along in new environments and, through grafting and hybridizing, created new varieties. Over the last 250 years, their activities transformed the American landscape.</p><p>"Horticulture" may bring to mind white-glove garden clubs and genteel lectures about growing better roses. But Philip J. Pauly wants us to think of horticulturalists as pioneer "biotechnologists," hacking their plants to create a landscape that reflects their ambitions and ideals. Those standards have shaped the look of suburban neighborhoods, city parks, and the "native" produce available in our supermarkets.</p><p>In telling the histories of Concord grapes and Japanese cherry trees, the problem of the prairie and the war on the Medfly, Pauly hopes to provide a new understanding of not only how horticulture shaped the vegetation around us, but how it influenced our experiences of the native, the naturalized, and the alien--and how better to manage the landscapes around us.</p></p><p>Philip J. Pauly was Professor of History at Rutgers University.Philip Pauly wants us to take the history of American Horticulture seriously, both to better understand the past and to more effectively meet the challenges of the present, as in the problem of pest control and the quandaries of ecological restoration. His arguments are thoughtful, creative, and his cases carefully researched. I was consistently enlightened on a number of fronts, from the debates over foresting the prairies to Harriet Beecher Stowe's interest in Florida as a moral landscape, to the battle over the Hessian fly. One of the striking virtues of the text is Pauly's seeming indefatigability in viewing his topic from multiple angles, almost as if he were a team of researchers rather than a single scholar. He has unearthed an impressive amount of primary sources that have scarcely been touched before, and juxtaposed the vagaries of climate and place, flora and fauna, the human and the artificial in ways that maintain a clear narrative thread in the face of a daunting multiplicity that is an impressive accomplishment. There will be many such as myself who will wish that this book had been available a decade or more ago. <i>Fruits and Plains</i> offers new perspectives that will stimulate much further interest, expanding its influence for some time to come. (Katherine Pandora, University of Oklahoma, author of the blog <i>Petri Dish</i>)<br><br><i>Fruits and Plains</i> adopts a novel approach to the history of contemporary restoration ecology and modern concerns about invasive species in America. Rather than view these practices as new developments in ecology and conservation biology, Philip Pauly shows how they can be seen as the culmination of a 200-year history of horticultural practice in the United States. (Sharon Kingsland <i>Science</i> 2008-04-25)<br><br>Philip Pauly has written a new chapter in the history of American horticulture...[The book has] some illuminating insights about the importance of American horticulture in the shaping of the nation.

Roberts <i>Choice</i> 2008-08-01)<br><br>Eye-opening...<i>Fruits and Plains</i> is skilled, authoritative, insightful, and original, a pioneering exploration of innovation in American horticulture and its relationship to the natural environment during the two centuries or so that preceded the recent emergence of agricultural biotechnology.

Seeming to criminalize disability and thus offering a visceral example of discrimination, these &#x201c;ugly laws&#x201d; have become a sort of shorthand for oppression in disability studies, law, and the arts.<br>In this watershed study of the ugly laws, Susan M. Schweik uncovers the murky history behind the laws, situating the varied legislation in its historical context and exploring in detail what the laws meant. Illustrating how the laws join the history of the disabled and the poor, Schweik not only gives the reader a deeper understanding of the ugly laws and the cities where they were generated, she locates the laws at a crucial intersection of evolving and unstable concepts of race, nation, sex, class, and gender. Moreover, she explores the history of resistance to the ordinances, using the often harrowing life stories of those most affected by their passage. Moving to the laws&#x2019; more recent history, Schweik analyzes the shifting cultural memory of the ugly laws, examining how they have been used&#x2014;and misused&#x2014;by academics, activists, artists, lawyers, and legislators.</p></p><p><b>Susan M. Schweik</b> is Professor of English and co-director of the Disability Studies Program at the University of California, Berkeley. She is the author of <i>A Gulf So Deeply Cut: American Women Poets and the Second World War</i>."Schweik draws on a deep index of resources, from legal proceedings to out-of-print books, to tell the story of individuals long lost to history." (<i>Publisher&#x2019;s Weekly</i>)<br><br>"Schweik delivers a compelling and insightful examination of disability norms, municipal law, and American culture. . . . She gives voice to the fascinating stories of the unsightly, the alienated, and the excluded. A valuable contribution for anyone interested in disability theory, poverty law and policy, and social history." (Paul Steven Miller,Director, Disability Studies Program, University of Washington)<br><br>"Sometimes you can judge a book by its cover. The stark photo by Paul Strand illustrating The Ugly Laws: Disability in Public conveys perfectly the realities and subtleties described in its pagesincluding the fear, pity, and revulsion with which the public so often regards those with physical disabilities." (<i>California Lawyer</i>)<br><br>"This book is, as Schweik convincingly caharacterizes it, 'a history of the harm done bylet us allow the phrase some forcelack of regard.' It provides useful background for understanding current efforts to encode and enforce protections for the disabled and disadvantaged." (Marilyn Chandler McEntyre <i>The Christian Century</i>)<br><br>"Shweik combines a sophisticated grasp of disability, critical race and social theory, extensive archival and legal research, close textual analysis, and broad reading in a wide range of historical and other literatures. Her account brings the insights of disability history and theory to bear on systems of exclusion, subordination, and othering more generally in American life as the United States entered the twentieth century... This is a powerful book, essential reading for scholars of disability, race, gender, sexuality, immigration, urban, legal, social movement, and twentieth-century history more generallyindeed, for anyone concerned about law and its power and the limits of that power to define borders of belonging." (<i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>"In analyzing the ugly laws, Schweik reveals how individuals have come to define their identities around work and self-sufficiency, and how the failure of those with disabilities to do so can result in character assassination of these individuals as frauds and morally bankrupt, diseased tricksters and thieves. A subtle and complex study." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"Overall, this is a thorough, careful, and sensible work, which is both fascinating and also moving as an account of social oppression of disabled people." (<i>Metapsychology Online Reviews</i>)<br><br>"What is ugliness, and how ugly is too ugly? Perverse though such discrimination might seem today, Schweik suggests that re-examining such laws &#x2018;might prove very useful as a way of foregrounding the inevitable ambiguity of the category of &amp; disability." (<i>The Chronicle Review</i>)<br><br>"The range of concerns illuminated by Schweik's materialist and historicist focus on the ordinances proves that The Ugly Laws has succeeded, as the book's poignant last words put it, in showing how much more we understand when we begin to face the history of disability'" (Jean Franzino <i>Register of the Kentucky Historical Society</i>)<br><br>"Schweik draws on a deep index of resources, from legal proceedings to out-of-print books, to tell the story of individuals long lost to history."

Professor Max Turner suggests that the place to begin answering such questions is the New Testament. What do the writers of the New Testament say about the work of the Holy Spirit, and how can we understand spiritual gifts for today? Turner looks carefully at the gospels of Luke and John and the writings of Paul and explores how they took over and developed Old Testament and intertestamental notions of the Spirit.

Some are obvious: the man who kills his girlfriend, then takes his own life, either out of remorse or because of his own inability to face the consequences of his actions; or the tit-for-tat murders of hoodlums, gangsters, drug dealers, each killing leading inexorably to another as the violence escalates. One death invites the next, extending a pale hand in greeting, grinning as the ax falls, the blade cuts. There is a chain of events that can easily be reconstructed, a clear trail for the law to follow.</p><p>But there are other killings that are harder to connect, the links between them obscured by great distances, by the passage of years, by the layering of this honeycomb world as time folds softly upon itself.</p><p>The honeycomb world does not hide secrets: it stores them. It is a repository of buried memories, of half-forgotten acts.</p><p>In the honeycomb world, everything is connected.<b></b></p><p><b>* * *</b></p><p>The St. Daniil sat on Brightwater Court, not far from the cavernous dinner clubs on Brighton Beach Avenue and Coney Island Avenue where couples of all ages danced to music in Russian, Spanish, and English, ate Russian food, shared vodka and wine, and watched stage shows that would not have been out of place in some of the more modest Reno hotels, or on a cruise ship, yet the St. Daniil was far enough away from them to render itself distinct in any number of ways. The building that it occupied overlooked the ocean, and the boardwalk with its principal trio of restaurants, the Volna, the Tatiana, and the Winter Garden, now screened to protect their patrons from the cool sea breeze and the stinging sands. Nearby was the Brighton playground, where, during the day, old men sat at stone tables playing cards while children cavorted nearby, the young and the not-so-young united together in the same space. New condos had sprung up to the east and west, part of the transformation that Brighton Beach had undergone in recent years.</p><p>But the St. Daniil belonged to an older dispensation, a different Brighton Beach, one occupied by the kind of businesses that made their money from those who were on nodding terms with poverty: check-cashing services that took 25 percent of every check cashed, then offered loans at a similar monthly rate to cover the shortfall; discount stores that sold cheap crockery with cracked glaze, and firetrap Christmas decorations all year round; former mom-and-pop grocery stores that were now run by the kind of men who looked like they might have the remains of mom and pop rotting in their cellars; laundromats frequented by men who smelt of the streets and who would routinely strip down to filthy shorts and sit, nearly naked, waiting for their clothes to wash before giving them a single desultory spin in the dryer (for every quarter counted) and then dress in the still-damp clothes, folding the rest into plastic garbage bags and venturing back onto the streets, their garments steaming slightly in the air; pawnshops that did a steady trade in redeemed and unredeemed items, for there was always someone willing to benefit from the misfortune of another; and storefronts with no name above the window and only a battered counter inside, the shadowy business conducted within of no interest to those who needed to be told its nature. Most of those places were gone now, relegated to side streets, to less desirable neighborhoods, pushed farther and farther back from the avenue and the sea, although those who needed their services would always know where to find them.</p><p>The St. Daniil remained, though. It endured. The St. Daniil was a club, although it was strictly private and had little in common with its glitzier counterparts on the avenue. Accessed through a steel-caged door, it occupied the basement of an old brownstone building surrounded by other brownstones of similar vintage although, while its neighbors had been cleaned up, the edifice occupied by the St. Daniil had not. It had once formed the main entrance to a larger complex, but changes to the internal structure of the buildings had isolated the St. Daniil between two significantly more attractive apartment blocks. The club's home now squatted in the middle of them like some poor relation that had muscled in on a family photo, unashamed of its ignominy.</p><p>Above the St. Daniil was a warren of small apartments, some big enough to be occupied by entire families, others small enough to accommodate only an individual, and one, at that, for whom space mattered less than privacy and anonymity. Nobody lived in those apartments now, not willingly. Some were used for storage: booze, cigarettes, electrical goods, assorted contraband. The rest acted as temporary quarters for young -- sometimes very young -- prostitutes and, when required, their clients. One or two of the rooms were marginally better furnished and maintained than others, and contained video cameras and recording equipment for the making of pornographic films.</p><p>Although it was known as the St. Daniil, the club did not have an official name. A plate beside the door read "Private Members Social Club" in English and Cyrillic, but it was not the kind of place where anyone went to be sociable. There was a bar there, but few lingered at it, and those who did stuck mostly to coff ee and killed time while waiting for errands to run, vig to collect, bones to break. A TV above the bar showed pirated DVDs, old hockey games, sometimes porn or, late at night, when all business had been conducted, film of Russian troops in Chechnya engaging in reprisals against their enemies, real or perceived. Worn hemispherical vinyl booths lined the walls, with scuff ed tables at their center, relics of a time when this really was a social club, a place where men could talk of the old country and share the newspapers that had arrived in the mail or in the suitcases of visitors and immigrants. The decor consisted mainly of framed copies of Soviet posters from the 1940s, bought for five bucks at RBC Video on Brighton Beach Avenue.</p><p>For a time, the police had kept watch on the club, but they had been unable to access it in order to plant a bug, and a wiretap on the phones had expired without anything useful being learned. Any business of consequence was, they suspected, now conducted on throwaway cellphones, the phones replaced religiously at the end of every week. Two raids by vice on the building through the doorway above the club had scored only a couple of johns and a handful of weary whores, few of whom had English and fewer of whom had papers. No pimps were ever apprehended, and the women, the cops knew, were easily replaced.</p><p>On those nights, the door to the St. Daniil had remained firmly closed, and when the cops finally gained entry to it they had found only a bored bartender and a pair of ancient, toothless Russians playing poker for matchsticks.</p><p>It was a mid-October evening. The light outside had long faded and only a single booth in the club was occupied. The man seated there was a Ukrainian known as the Priest. He had studied in an Orthodox seminary for three years before discovering his true vocation, which lay primarily in providing the kinds of services for which priests were usually required to off er forgiveness. The club's unofficial name was a testament to the Priest's brief flirtation with the religious life. The St. Daniil monastery was Moscow's oldest cloister, a stronghold of the Orthodox faith even during the worst excesses of the Communist era, when many of its priests had become martyrs and the remains of St. Daniil himself had been smuggled to America in order to save them from harm.</p><p>Unlike many of those who worked for him, the Priest spoke English with hardly a trace of an accent. He had been part of the first influx of immigrants from the Soviet Union, working hard to learn the ways of this new world, and he could still recall a time when Brighton Beach had been nothing but old people living in rent-controlled apartments surrounded by little vacant houses falling into decay, a far cry from the days when this area was a beacon for immigrants and New Yorkers alike anxious to leave the crowded neighborhoods of Brownsville, East New York, and Manhattan's Lower East Side for space in which to live and the feel of sea air in their lungs. He prided himself on his sophistication. He read the <i>Times</i>, not the Post. He went to the theater. When he was in his realm, there was no porn on the TV, no poorly copied DVDs. Instead, it was tuned to BBC World, or sometimes CNN. He did not like Fox News. It looked inward, and he was a man who was always looking at the greater world outside. He drank tea during the day, and only compote, a fruit punch that tasted of plums, at night. He was an ambitious man, a prince who wished to become a king. He paid obeisance to the old men, the ones who had been imprisoned under Stalin, the ones whose fathers had created the criminal enterprise that had now reached its zenith in a land far from their own. But even as he bowed before them, the Priest looked for ways in which they might be undermined. He calculated the strength of potential rivals among his own generation and prepared his people for the inevitable bloodshed, sanctioned or unsanctioned, that would come. Recently, there had been some reversals. The mistakes might have been avoided, but he was not entirely to blame for them. Unfortunately, there were others who did not see it that way. Perhaps, he thought, the bloodshed would have to begin sooner than expected.</p><p>Today had been a bad day, another in a succession of bad days. There had been a problem with the restrooms that morning and the place still stank, even though the diffi culty had apparently been solved once the drain people, from a fi rm trusted by the organization, got on the case. On another day, the Priest might well have left the club and gone elsewhere, but there was business to be conducted and loose ends to be tied...</p></p><h2>The Jews in America</h2><p>The United States now has the largest Jewish population of any country in the world. This vibrant and diverse community of nearly six million has flourished in America&#39;s atmosphere of religious freedom, tolerance and enterprise. THE JEWS IN AMERA is the result of the most ambitious photographic project ever to focus on the American Jewish community. Over the course of nearly a year, 60 of the nation&#39;s finest magazine and newspaper photographers spread out across the country, creating a composite portrait of contemporary American Jewish life, recording it traditions, beliefs and achievements. From the row houses of Brooklyn to Jewish cowboys in California, from a Bar Mitzvah in Houston to a chicken soup cook-off in Minneapolis, the photographs document a small bright chapter in the long history of a people. Photographs depicting Jewish customs and traditions are accompanied by clear, concise explanations which make the book accessible to Jews and non-Jews alike. THE JEWS IN AMERICA also features an introductory essay by acclaimed author Chaim Potok and is produced by the editors and photographers of the bestselling &#39;Day in the Life&#39; series.</p><p>A glossy, predictable paean to American Jewry by the producers of the Day in the Life series, this oversize collection of photographs traverses the country, capturing cowboys and Soviet Jewry activists, magicians and roving rabbis. The belabored point here is that Jews have special customs--circumcision, bar mitzvah, Passover seder--that set them apart, but Jews are also as American as apple pie. Hence, many of the 197 pictures, most of them color, reiterate that Jews are just regular folk: there are cozy multigenerational shots and photos of Jewish doctors, astronauts, hikers, soldiers, prisoners, casket-makers, emotionally disturbed youth. Cohen, co-editor of Christmas in America , plays up a familiar ethnic focus on food and stardom (a photograph of Steven Spielberg and his mom, Leah Adler, who owns a kosher L.A. restaurant, combines the two themes). A picture of the Jewish attorneys of a Century City law firm smacks of ghettoization and one of a woman immersing herself in a Brooklyn ritual bath is intrusive. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Suitable Boy</h2><p>THE FINAL VOLUME IN THE TRILOGY.LATA FINALLY MAKES HER DECISION &amp; THE WHOLE ENDSAS IT STARTED WITH A WEDDING.</p><p>Vikram Seth was born in 1952. He trained as an economist and has lived for several years each in England, California, China and India. He is the author of A Suitable Boy, which was an international number one bestseller, An Equal Music and several other novels. He has also written five volumes of poetry including Beastly Tales.Set in newly independent India, Nehru's early 1950's, this adipose saga counterbalances a book of social manners--the marrying off of a well-to-do educated young woman, Lata Mehra--with a historical account (even at the level of transcribed parliamentary debate) of the subcontinent trying to find its societal bearings vis-...-vis language, religion, and the redistribution of estate-lands taken off the hands of the elite. Set mainly in Brahmpur, the story encompasses four well-off families, with a focus mostly on the younger members--poets, academics, playboys, newlyweds--who stitch a pattern of peccadillo through their elders' expectations. Meanwhile, Seth, whose California novel in verse, The Golden Gate (1986), was clever and energetic in concept but dull and soapy in final effect, falls into the same trap here: lots of stuff obviously--at a marathon 1300-plus pages--but characters made out of clich&#x201a;, with background-India the very stuffed pillow of local color that keeps them standing. The book, too, fairly squeaks with its own pleasure in itself, larded with poetry and a general recommendation of art over politics and money: the characters it spends the most time over are narcissists. Anyone wanting to read how a marriageable daughter can X-ray a whole society ought to let this cream-puff-wrapped-in-a-cinder-block pass and return to Tanizaki's classic Japanese masterpiece, The Makioka Sisters.

By planting certain carefully selected trees and shrubs, you can create an attractive landscape that will encourage a wide variety of birds to visit your backyard, whether you have acres of land or just a small garden.<br>The National Audubon Society's Bird Garden provides a fully illustrated guide to garden birds, and the plants that will attract them, all conveniently organized into five geographic regions. Here is complete information concerning the nest, the song, and the food preferences of 100 familiar garden birds. Descriptions and lists of more than 300 trees, shrubs, and other plants explain their growth habits and cultural preferences, their hardiness, and the birds that rely on them for food or cover.<br>Birds are often attracted to the garden by nestboxes and platforms, feeders, dust baths, and water sources. These features are described and illustrated, with clear, concise directions for construction.</p><p>Stephen W. Kress, Ph.D., is a research fellow at Cornell University and an adjunct faculty member at the University of Maine.Landscaping to attract wildlife has become a popular gardening activity, not only in rural settings but also in suburbia and even in cities. Here are three titles showing the way, each with a different focus and varying success rate. All are profusely illustrated with excellent color photographs. Kress, a highly accomplished naturalist and the author of two top-quality Audubon Society guides on birding and attracting birds, presents informative chapters on landscaping, plantings, nesting structures, feeding, use of water, and a regional reference to plants and birds. This is an excellent guide to attracting birds but suffers slightly from a plethora of sidebars and columns on individual birds and plants, although there is no discussion of hummingbird feeding. One wishes for more of Kress's fine, overarching, generalized text. Nevertheless, The Bird Garden can be highly recommended for all gardening collections. Tufts, the chief naturalist and manager of the National Wildlife Federation's (NWF) Backyard Wildlife Habitat Program, and noted garden writer Loewer, offer a guide that is less compartmentalized with a more cohesive, expository text. The emphasis is more on the use of vegetation, natural shelter, and water to attract a broad spectrum of animals, not just birds. Although the approach is less cookbook and more conceptual, the book still has many practical qualities, but specifics on feeders and nesting boxes are not included. Chapters discuss creating a habitat; getting the garden ready; creating woodland gardens; meadow and prairie gardens; water gardens; gardening for birds, butterflies, and nightlife; and profiles of 15 NWF backyard habitats. This is an excellent overview of of how to garden for wildlife. Needham's Beastly Abodes tries a more direct, nuts-and-bolts approach with 74 sections written by 17 authors on how to build boxes, feeders, rafts, etc., for a variety of wildlife such as bats, butterflies, birds, as well as such as toads, mice, squirrels, turtles, bees, et al. There is much useful information but also an unfortunate emphasis on artistic, even garish, houses. A birdhouse that looks as if it were painted by Piet Mondrian, one that resembles a chrome diner, or a squirrel house with an elaborate acorn design may appeal to many people but the creatures for which they were intended are better served by abodes that are natural and unembellished. Because of such fanciful airs and in the face of an abundance of well-crafted current books on attracting wildlife, Beastly Abodes is not recommended. These new books add considerably to our knowledge of attracting wildlife but the bedrock?established by earlier titles by Kress, such John V. Dennis works as The Complete Guide to Bird Feeding (Knopf, 1994), and the excellent Ortho Books series?still remains vital.?Henry T.

Schechter's focus is quite a bit tighter, and more traditionally biographical, than Paul Hoffman's in <i>The Man Who Loved Only Numbers</i>. Here, we get to see Erd�s's brief childhood transform quickly into a carefree adolescence of solving difficult math problems with his circle of brilliant friends--uniquely encouraged by a country that valued the contributions of mathematics in a way that has never been equaled. Fleeing the Holocaust, Erd�s never settled down, instead traveling from place to place, showing up on the doorsteps of other mathematicians with his few possessions and an open mind. During his career, Erd�s published more papers than any other mathematician in history. Most of the papers were collaborations:<p> </p><blockquote> For Erd�s, the mathematics that consumed most of his waking hours was not a solitary pursuit but a social activity. One of the great mathematical discoveries of the twentieth century was the simple equation that two heads are better than one.... That radical transformation of how mathematics is created is the result of many factors, not the least of which was the infectious example set by Erd�s.</blockquote> <p> Schechter spoke with many of Erd�s's collaborators to complete this biography, which reveals the odd mathematician as charming, opinionated, and completely dependent upon the kindness of others. Schechter not only tells his fascinating story, but introduces some intriguing mathematics problems (with easy-to-understand explanations) to show readers <i>why</i> Erd�s loved the elegance of numbers more than anything else in the world. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>A pleasing biography of the mathematician . . . by physicist, editor, and journalist Schechter. Erdos took part in the flowering of Hungarian creative and intellectual talent that developed in the first decades of this century with von Neumann, Teller, Szilard, von Karman, and Wigner in science, and Solti, Szell, Reiner, Dorati, Bartok, and Kodaly in music. His parents, nonpracticing Jews, were both high school teachers. At four, Erdos was already in love with numbers and at home with performing rapid calculations. When asked, "What is 100 minus 250?" he thought for a moment, and then shouted "150 below zero!," thereby inventing negative numbers for himself. And it was the theory of numbers that remained the first love of his mathematical life. What makes this biography so amenable to the general reader is that many conjectures raised by number theorists are also grasped easily by nonspecialists. Schechter reconstructs Erds's life through interviews and memoirs of his friends, most importantly , Ronald Graham, the AT&amp;T mathematician who became Erdos's "handler" after his adored and adoring mother's death. Indeed, therein lies a tale to titillate Freudians. It is said that Erdos had never buttered his own bread before leaving home for Cambridge. He chose not to marry and professed to be appalled by sex. Yet he loved children, whom he called "epsilons" (a math insider's joke) and was rich in friendships. Erdos left Hungary before WWII, never won a permanent teaching post, was usually short of mon ey, and got into trouble during the McCarthy era, but was undaunted and eventually cleared. Not only did he advance number theory and create new specialties in mathematics, but he also shifted math's working style from that of a solo enterprise to joint a nd multiple collaborations. Schechter has mined his sources well to create a captivating portrait.</p><h2>You Can&#39;t Take a Balloon into the National Gallery</h2><p>A little girl&#39;s trip to see the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. parallels the journey of her runaway ballon, in this introduction to the sights and sounds of our nation&#39;s capital. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 5-This zany adventure features the same intrepid grandmother who appeared in You Can't Take a Balloon into the Metropolitan Museum (Dial, 1998), here taking a grandson and granddaughter to visit the National Gallery. The granddaughter leaves her red balloon outside with a kind entrepreneur who takes pictures of tourists. As grandmother and children explore the highlights of the famous institution, the balloon escapes from the hands of the photographer and is buffeted about Washington, DC, followed by an accumulating parade of people who resemble characters in a slapstick silent comedy. As the balloon blows past the sights of the capital, the scenes echo the works of art that the family sees in the gallery. Some of these connections are amusing and clever (a George Bellows painting of a prizefight parallels a picture of the floor of the U.S. Senate where fists are raised); others are more strained (Matisse's "Large Composition with Masks" has little in common with the Queen of the Cherry Blossom Parade except in palette). The illustrator effectively uses full color to highlight the dramatic focus in each energetic pen-and-ink sketch. Front and back matter include a map of Washington and lists of the reproductions and "Faces from History" that are found throughout the book.

Those responsible for the torture and murder of millions of innocent and defenseless civilians were promised that &#34;... the three Allied Powers will pursue them to the furthest corners of the earth and deliver them to their judges so that justice may be done.&#34; That promise was not kept. Justice has not been done. In 1945, twelve of the most notorious Nazis were tried for crimes against humanity and sentenced to death by the International Military Tribunal convened at Nuremberg. (Martin Bormann, his whereabouts unknown, had been tried and convicted in absentia.) Subsequent war-crimes trials ended in the conviction of other offenders. But the majority of the torturers and murderers -- who, in one decade, had made this the bloodiest century in history -- have escaped, found sanctuary, and have continued to work effectively toward the concept of eventual world domination. Nazism did not die at Nuremberg. This survival and resurgence, no mere accident, is the result of a brilliant, complex plan for the creation of a &#34;brotherhood&#34; initiated long before the end of the war by the least visible and most powerful of the Nazi war lords -- Martin Bormann. The Brotherhood, backed by virtually unlimited funds, established &#34;safe&#34; houses inside German, escapt routes to other countries and continents, and an extensive international group of industrial firms as financial reservoirs and as &#34;fronts&#34; for escaped Nazis. The Brotherhood has been revealed in certain named guises, OSESSA for ex. This chronicle, based upon independent investigation, including numerous exclusive interviews and the examination of recently declassified and revealing documents, casts a new light upon that insidious man, Bormann, his strange role in the 3rd Reich, and his devastating influence, which cuts mercilessly into our present.

But a lot's happened since then, and he's in the mood to discuss it all, in the inimitable style that's made him the most popular social commentator to tickle people AND tick them off. From being PC to watching MTV, from rednecks to black militants, from singing the praises of the South to sounding off on the problems of just about everywhere else, nothing and nobody escapes when Grizzard shoots from the lip...and hits the "nekkid" truth every time.In his 16 previous books (You Can't Put No Boogie- Woogie on the King of Rock and Roll, etc.), Grizzard depicted himself as an unreconstructed rebel and unregenerate good ol' Georgia boy with a winning Well, that's the way I am attitude. No longer. He has been worked over by the liberal media, he believes, citing chapter and verse from the New York Times and the Washington Post to prove it. As a result, he is now a Pat Buchanan-style conservative, and his defense of his beloved Dixie has taken on a hard edge, featuring a particular dislike of New York City. This book is essentially a defense of the world he was raised in and of ideas that evidently have not changed since he reached age 16 in 1962. Some of these notions, such as that hard work is to be valued, form part of the warp and woof of America and will find a warm reception. Others will not: denying that he is a sexist because he kept none of his three wives barefoot and pregnant, he also says he doesn't want to meet any girls who know that Montpelier is the capital of Vermont; denying he is homophobic, he allows that he finds gays disruptive and devious, listing almost a full page of abusive names to substitute for gay. Cloaked as an attack on political correctness, this hymn to yesteryear is sad rather than funny. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Godwink Effect: 7 Secrets to God&#39;s Signs, Wonders, and Answered Prayers (5) (The Godwink Series)</h2><p>From the authors of the popular and bestselling Godwink series comes a new and inspiring collection of true stories about people whose lives were changed by specific and extraordinary answers to their prayers.<br><br>Prayer is a universal concept that anyone can do. It simply involves conversation between you and God, and oftentimes brings incredible and astonishing results. The outcomes are called &#x201c;answered prayer.&#x201d; Yet, with no alternative word in the English language for answered prayer, readers have begun to fill the void with <i>Godwink,</i> which is now making its way into dictionaries.<br> <br> In <i>The Godwink Effect</i>, SQuire and Louise, husband and wife, make the case that Godwinks and prayer are inextricably intertwined. Simply put, the first of seven secrets for more Godwinks is to pray. Moreover, when a Godwink occurs, like a pebble tossed into a pond, there are subsequent ripples that touch the lives of others.<br> <br> Typical of all Godwink books, this volume is packed with amazing real-life stories about ordinary people, as well as some well-known figures, that reinforce the power of prayer in their lives and the Godwinks that followed.</p><p>SQuire Rushnell is a popular speaker and&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author who has coined the term &#x201c;Godwink,&#x201d; now in mainstream usage. Within more than one million books in print, SQuire&#x2019;s Godwink stories are a popular monthly feature on the NBC&nbsp;<i>Today Show</i>.

When you pray more, you experience more Godwinks. The best prayer is intentional, but God occasionally proves He can hear your heart by answering unintentional or even unasked prayers.<br> DOUBT<p></p> <br>In the beginning I was feeling uncertain.<br> <br>Who was I to be spouting this thesis about Godwinks? I&#x2019;m not a theologian, a philosopher, or a scholar. I&#x2019;m merely a TV executive. Just one of the guys who brought you Schoolhouse Rock.<br> <br>But then I came across a statement that gave me encouragement, a statement by seventeenth-century religious leader Sir William Temple:<br> <br>When I pray,<br> <br>coincidences happen.<br> <br>When I don&#x2019;t,<br> <br>they don&#x2019;t!<br> <br>I&#x2019;m not alone! I thought.<br> <br>Sir William lifted my spirits by validating my theory that Godwinks are connected to prayer. And this notion existed not just in my head but was held by others!<br> <br>Of course I now joke that I can&#x2019;t fault the knighted evangelist for failing to use the proper word&#x2014;Godwink instead of coincidence. The word wasn&#x2019;t around in the 1600s.<br> <br>But I do enjoy paraphrasing Sir William:<br> <br>When I pray,<br> <br>Godwinks happen.<br> <br>When I don&#x2019;t,<br> <br>they don&#x2019;t.<br> <br>So, in partnership with Sir William, we would like to introduce you to the first of Seven Secrets to God&#x2019;s Signs, Wonders, and Answered Prayers.<br> <br>The first secret, very simply, is . . . pray.<br> <br>When you pray, you clear the way for blessings that are waiting to be released. More prayer, more power. Less prayer, less power. Prayer is mysteriously related to the rate of Godwinks that flow into your life.<br> YOUR COMMUNICATION WITH HIM<p></p> <br>Simply put, prayer is communication between you and God. You can talk to Him anytime from anywhere about anything, and you can talk to God much the way you would chat with a dear grandfather whom you admire and respect, who hangs on your every word, and who wants to know everything about everything you&#x2019;re doing, about what excites you and what concerns you.<br> <br>One difference between your grandfather and God, though, is that the latter can literally move mountains and earth to comfort you, protect you, inspire you, and guide you to where you need to go.<br> GOD&#x2019;S COMMUNICATION TO YOU<p></p> <br>God hardly ever speaks to us in an out-loud, human voice. It happens, but very rarely.<br> <br>Instead, sometimes you hear an inner voice that seems as clear and as distinct as the words to a song inside your head. That&#x2019;s infrequent as well.<br> <br>More commonly, you feel a powerful inner sense that you need to do something&#x2014;go check on the baby, watch that car that&#x2019;s coming from another direction, say something specific to a specific someone.<br> <br>For most people, however, the most frequent form of direct, person-to-Person communication from God happens through Godwinks. Why not? Why wouldn&#x2019;t God use a nonverbal and totally amazing way to communicate to let you know that it&#x2019;s Him?<br> <br>As you develop the ability to see Godwinks all around you, you&#x2019;ll see more and more of them more and more often. For Louise and me, it is now rare that we don&#x2019;t see Godwinks several times a day.<br> INTENTIONAL PRAYER<p></p> <br>Intentional prayer is the best kind of prayer: you intentionally speak with God about a very specific need or issue. That&#x2019;s what Kate Hughes did, and her astonishing story will touch most of us. One medical issue after another drained her bank account, tested her stamina, and gave her a stage on which to demonstrate that when you engage in daily intentional prayer, God listens to you.<br> <br>If you don&#x2019;t already agree, Kate&#x2019;s story may change your thinking.<br> <br><br> Kate&#x2019;s Godwinks and the Wedding<p></p> <br>Kate sat on the couch, opening mail. One envelope was plump and clearly of a high-quality paper. She carefully opened it.<br> <br>As if it were a precious treasure map, she held the wedding invitation with both hands. It was beautiful. The raised lettering, in script, announced that in about a month her son, James, would marry his fianc�e, Dana, in Sedona, Arizona.<br> <br>Kate broke down in tears.<br> <br>Regaining her composure, she sighed audibly and unconsciously ran a finger over the lettering on the card.<br> <br>&#x201c;God, I know that if You want me to go to this wedding, You&#x2019;ll make the way.&#x201d;<br> <br>The statement was matter-of-fact because Kate was strong in her faith. In her daily chats with her Creator, she always spoke in a conversational tone. She believed God listened not only to her prayers&#x2014;and answered them, according to His will&#x2014;but also to her heart. She knew that He knew how desperately she wanted to be at that wedding! He also knew she was flat broke!<br> <br>With only a part-time job and piles of medical bills, there was no way on earth she could afford a plane ticket from Melbourne, Florida, to Arizona.<br> <br>Her recent phone conversation with Dana and James had been sad. Aware of her situation, the bride and groom wanted her to know the invitation was going out. They knew she&#x2019;d been praying and praying for God to provide a way for her to attend. They truly wished they were in a financial position to be able to get her there, but that wasn&#x2019;t an option. No one had a solution.<br> <br>All three of them cried.<br> <br>For several years Kate had been dealing with some serious health issues. First, an auto accident left her with a fractured back. Then she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy. After that, a heart disorder that had lingered since childhood required open-heart surgery. Next was the grim discovery that she&#x2019;d suffered a stroke.<br> <br>During this time the company she worked for collapsed and her mortgage underwriter job disappeared. Managers at a second mortgage company had no patience with her health problems, so she lost that job and couldn&#x2019;t find other work.<br> <br>Yet Kate stood by God because she knew that He stood by her.<br> <br>Her faith was tested, yet she refused to let any of these circumstances rob her of her joy. She maintained her upbeat personality and kept her vow to make at least one person smile every day.<br> <br>Kate felt blessed the day she went for a job interview with Jeanne Ford, a manager at Cracker Barrel in Viera, Florida, a half hour from Kate&#x2019;s home. Jeanne was encouraging. Even though Kate did not try to hide her health issues&#x2014;not even the scars on her chest from heart surgery&#x2014;Jeanne said, &#x201c;I love your bubbly personality. I don&#x2019;t have a lot of work, but we could try you out part-time.&#x201d;<br> <br>When a server&#x2019;s position turned out to be too hard on Kate physically, Jeanne suggested she might be better suited to work as a cashier.<br> <br>Kate thanked God profusely.<br> <br>Again and again Jeanne saw the wisdom of the decision to have Kate work as a cashier. But what Jeanne didn&#x2019;t know was that she herself was a Godwink Link. (That&#x2019;s the term I&#x2019;ve coined for someone who delivers another person a Godwink without even knowing they&#x2019;re doing it.) Jeanne had no idea that her decision to hire Kate when others wouldn&#x2019;t would set the stage for Kate to experience the biggest Godwink of her life.<br> <br>Kate was thrilled to get the part-time job as a cashier. It didn&#x2019;t completely cover her needs, but she would keep praying for another part-time job to cover her shortfall.<br> <br>As Kate prayed and waited, Cracker Barrel treated her well, and her coworkers felt like family. So she always arrived a half hour before her shift to deliver cookies or just spread a little joy. And her job as a cashier continues to be a great fit.<br> <br>&#x201c;I love my job,&#x201d; exclaims Kate, &#x201c;because I love talking to people!&#x201d;<br> <br>We can all learn from Kate. When, like Kate, we greet each day with an attitude of gratitude for the things God has given us, rather than donning a cloak of dark resentment for the burdens we must bear, He lets others see the joy in our hearts as He shines through us. Some will see&#x2014;but not necessarily recognize&#x2014;God&#x2019;s love in our warm smiles and welcoming ways. A few people will know the true Source of Kate&#x2019;s thankful spirit and ours.<br> <br>As the day of the wedding grew closer, Kate faithfully prayed her intentional daily prayer just a teeny bit louder: &#x201c;God, I know that if You want me to go to this wedding, You&#x2019;ll make the way!&#x201d;<br> <br>When the week of the wedding came, Jeannie considerately saw to it that Kate&#x2019;s schedule required more work hours than usual to help her keep her mind off the big event.<br> <br>When Kate looked over the schedule, she appreciated that it called for her to work on Saturday, the day of the wedding, as well as the evening before.<br> <br>So on Friday Kate arrived for work at three thirty, greeted her colleagues, put on her uniform, and, promptly at four, took her place behind the register.<br> <br>It was a typical Cracker Barrel dinner crowd. The restaurant was jammed between five and six, and Kate chatted with everyone as they left, asking if they&#x2019;d enjoyed themselves and cheerfully inviting them to &#x201c;please come again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Kate, what in the world are you doing here! You should be at your son&#x2019;s wedding!&#x201d;<br> <br>It was Rose, one of Kate&#x2019;s coworkers, as she walked past the cashier&#x2019;s station. Kate knew Rose had been out of the loop, because pretty much everyone else had known for weeks that she would be missing the wedding.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well . . . I was feeling pretty good . . . till you mentioned it,&#x201d; Kate replied with the best smile she could muster.<br> <br>She turned to see a man and a woman next in line ready to pay their check. They both wore airline uniforms. Eager to change the subject, Kate smiled and said brightly, &#x201c;Southwest! My favorite airline!&#x201d;<br> <br>The flight attendants smiled.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re missing your son&#x2019;s wedding?&#x201d; inquired the woman, who had obviously overheard the exchange with Rose.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, yeah . . . I can&#x2019;t afford to go. He&#x2019;s getting married tomorrow north of Phoenix.&#x201d;<br> <br>Not wanting to sound like she was feeling sorry for herself, Kate turned on her most cheerful attitude. &#x201c;Hey, do you two fly to Vegas?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; they both answered. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s our regular route.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, why don&#x2019;t you sneak me onto the plane, strap a parachute on my back, and shove me out over Phoenix!&#x201d; Kate giggled.<br> <br>Everyone laughed.<br> <br>The airline workers paid their bill and said good-bye.<br> <br>Kate continued ringing up customers.<br> <br>Moments later she looked up and was surprised to see that the airline workers had returned. Both wore wide smiles. The woman glanced at Kate&#x2019;s name tag and spoke first.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kate, I&#x2019;m Angela Gibbs. This is my fianc�, Ruben Darancou.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you get tomorrow off?&#x201d; asked Ruben.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; said Kate, startled.<br> <br>&#x201c;We found two Southwest Buddy Passes in our bags in the car. Those are standby tickets to get you to Phoenix and back,&#x201d; Ruben continued.<br> <br>Kate was dumbfounded. Her eyes began to fill with tears.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh my! Thank you&#x2014;and thank You, God!&#x201d; said Kate as she put everything together and realized what was happening.<br> <br>&#x201c;She sure can get tomorrow off!&#x201d; shouted Katrina, a coworker who was at the register next to Kate&#x2019;s. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take her shift!&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t believe this! thought Kate as her oft-uttered prayer flashed like a neon sign in her mind: God, I know that if You want me to go to this wedding, You&#x2019;ll make the way.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, then, let&#x2019;s see how we can get you there,&#x201d; said Angie, pulling out her cell phone.<br> <br>&#x201c;What time is the wedding?&#x201d; asked Ruben.<br> <br>Wow, God! You really did it! said Kate inside her head. &#x201c;Oh . . . uh . . . the wedding&#x2019;s at four p.m.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;OK, can you be at Orlando Airport for a six fifteen a.m. flight?&#x201d; continued Angie, looking at the schedule on her phone. &#x201c;That would get you to Phoenix at about eleven in the morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; said Kate, dazed by what was unfolding.<br> <br>A small group was now gathering around her, all smiling joyfully. Everyone was feeling the excitement.<br> <br>Before they left the restaurant, Angie handed Kate a business card with her number on it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let us know how you make out,&#x201d; Angie said, smiling sweetly.<br> <br>A short while later Kate was in her car, driving home to pack, grab about an hour&#x2019;s sleep, and then get up for the one-hour drive to Orlando Airport.<br> <br>During the drive she kept repeating aloud, in disbelief, &#x201c;Wow, God! You did it! You really did it!&#x201d;<br> <br>Later on, when she had time to reflect, she would clearly see that first Jeanne and then Angie and Ruben were all Godwink Links. Each of them was an unwitting player in a drama that became Kate&#x2019;s best Godwink ever! This experience reaffirmed for her that prayer works . . . and that when you are faithful to God every day of your life, when you remain in conversation with Him, He is right there beside you and faithful to you!<br> <br>When Kate landed in Phoenix, she found her way to a bus to Sedona, learned the drive would take two hours, and was soon on her way. By the time she was close to her destination, Kate had made friends with the woman sitting next to her. Kate&#x2019;s excitement was visible.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to surprise everyone!&#x201d; said Kate, beaming. &#x201c;No one knows I&#x2019;m coming. But I have a sense from God that when I walk into that hotel lobby, I&#x2019;m going to see my eleven-year-old grandson running around.&#x201d; She laughed and added, &#x201c;Most of my grandchildren call me Grammie, but Ethin made up a new name. I called him &#x2018;Pumpkin&#x2019; one time, so he decided to call me &#x2018;Cupcake.&#x2019;?&#x201d; She laughed again.<br> <br>About two p.m. Kate walked through the front door of the hotel.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cupcake! What are you doing here?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was Ethin, just about to get on the elevator.<br> <br>God was winking again.<br> <br>The boy ran to Kate and hugged her.<br> <br>She put a finger to her lips. &#x201c;Shh. I want to surprise everyone. I need your help. Where&#x2019;s your mom?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s in the beauty salon with Dana . . . and Uncle Jamie&#x2019;s upstairs. They have to get pictures taken.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then let&#x2019;s get busy,&#x201d; said Kate, lifting an eyebrow and smiling at her co-conspirator as she nudged him toward the front desk. There she shared her secret with the attendant, asking if she would call up to her son, James Kramer, and tell him there was a time-sensitive package for him in the front lobby that he had to come down right away and sign for.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>James was feeling a bit annoyed. He had to finish getting dressed, he needed to be at a particular place for the bridal party photo shoot at a particular time, and now the front desk was insisting that he go downstairs right away for a &#x201c;time-sensitive&#x201d; package.<br> <br>What the heck could be so time-sensitive? he kept asking himself as he rode down the elevator.<br> <br>When the elevator doors opened, there she was! His mother!<br> <br>&#x201c;Wha&#x2014; Wow&#x2014;Mom! What are you doing here?&#x201d; he blurted with a huge smile.<br> <br>He took her in his arms and gave her a bear hug.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, you&#x2019;ve got to tell me how you pulled this off! But not right now! Later! I&#x2019;ve got to get to the photo shoot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All right! You go, honey,&#x201d; said Kate with a kiss. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll talk later.&#x201d;<br> <br>She couldn&#x2019;t help giggling. This was definitely the best surprise ever!<br> <br>A few minutes later Kate walked into the beauty salon and saw that Dana, the bride-to-be and her future daughter-in-law, and her daughter, Michelle, were standing at the register settling the bill. They were turned away from her.<br> <br>&#x201c;You two look beautiful. Are you attending a wedding?&#x201d; asked Kate cheerfully.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom!&#x201d; said Michelle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh my God!&#x201d; squealed Dana. &#x201c;Yo...</p><h2>A Little Taste of Poison</h2><p>Twelve-year-old Isaveth tries to take down the man who framed her father for murder in this lively follow-up to <i>A Pocket Full of Murder</i>, which <i>Kirkus Reviews </i>called &#x201c;thoroughly entertaining.&#x201d;<br><br>The city of Tarreton is powered by magic, from simple tablets that light lamps to advanced Sagery that can murder a man from afar.

The reception room was hot and smelled of baccy; a clump of snow melted off her boot and plopped onto the diamond-patterned carpet. She longed to take off her coat, but the wool was too damp to lay it on her lap, and she could see nowhere else to put it.<br> <br>On the opposite wall, a brass plate trumpeted the name of the man Isaveth had come to see: J. J. WREGGET, PRESIDENT. Meanwhile his personal secretary, lean and elegant in a brown suit that nearly matched his skin, shuffled papers while speaking to the call box on his desk: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Mister Wregget is in a meeting.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Pardon?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, he&#x2019;s booked until next Mendday.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isaveth shifted uncomfortably. This sumptuous ultra-modern office, the inner sanctum of the Glow-Mor Light and Fire Company, was no place for a stonemason&#x2019;s daughter from Cabbage Street. Especially one barely thirteen years old. What could the president of the biggest spell-factory in Tarreton want with her?<br> <br>True, she&#x2019;d invented a magic-resistant paper that was perfect for wrapping spell-tablets, and once Mister Wregget had seen it he&#x2019;d been eager to buy the recipe. But that was months ago, and Isaveth had nothing more to offer him. Even the five imperials he&#x2019;d paid her&#x2014;half a year&#x2019;s wages for poor folk like herself&#x2014;was spent now, gone to pay off old debts and buy her family warm clothes, boots without holes in them, and other long-overdue necessities. In fact, if Papa couldn&#x2019;t find better work than the odd jobs he&#x2019;d been doing, they&#x2019;d soon have to apply for relief again.<br> <br>Dread clutched at Isaveth&#x2019;s chest. What if the president wasn&#x2019;t pleased with her invention? What if he&#x2019;d called her here to demand his money back?<br> <br>Perhaps she&#x2019;d been reckless, coming all the way to the Glow-Mor office by herself. But Papa hadn&#x2019;t been home when the message boy delivered Mister Wregget&#x2019;s summons, and Isaveth hadn&#x2019;t felt comfortable showing it to her older sister, Annagail&#x2014;let alone the younger girls, Lilet and Mimmi. After all the troubles they&#x2019;d been through since their mother died, she hated to tell them anything until she was certain it was good news.<br> <br>Right now, though, she&#x2019;d settle for it not being too crushingly bad. Sweat prickled beneath her collar and she fumbled open the top button of her coat, but it didn&#x2019;t help. She felt ready to faint by the time the outer door swung open at last, and a balding, ruddy-faced man in a striped waistcoat strode in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Miss Breck!&#x201d; he enthused, engulfing her hand in his big pink one. &#x201c;What a pleasure. Tambor, take the young lady&#x2019;s coat.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isaveth struggled out of her winter things and piled them on the secretary, then hurried to catch up as Mister Wregget marched into his office. He sat down, gesturing her to the chair in front of his desk.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a straightforward man, Miss Breck,&#x201d; he said as the privacy door swung shut, &#x201c;so I won&#x2019;t bore you with a lot of preamble. How would you like to go to Tarreton College?&#x201d;<br> <br>Isaveth goggled at him. Tarreton College was the most exclusive upper-grade school in the city, where the children of the nobility and wealthy merchant families received the finest education&#x2014;general and magical&#x2014;that money could provide. He might as well have asked Isaveth how she&#x2019;d like to fly. &#x201c;I&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve never dreamed of such a thing, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then you need to dream bigger, young lady! Because I&#x2019;d like to offer you this year&#x2019;s Glow-Mor scholarship.&#x201d; He leaned back, smiling beatifically. &#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s a mite unusual to start partway through the year, but you&#x2019;re a bright girl, and I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll soon catch up. And if you make it through fallowtime and planting terms with good marks, we&#x2019;ll renew the offer next harvest: full tuition, with all books and materials included. What do you say?&#x201d;<br> <br>He couldn&#x2019;t be serious. Or if he was, he must be losing his mind. The magic taught at Tarreton College was Sagery, an ancient craft very different from the spell-baking Isaveth had learned from her mother. Instead of recipes using magewort, binding powder, and other cheap ingredients, Sagery relied on precise formulations of precious metals and gemstones to create the kinds of charms only wealthy folk could afford. Its secrets had been jealously guarded for centuries, and some even considered it sacred; it was no craft for a commoner, as the proud masters and mistresses of the college would surely agree.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir,&#x201d; said Isaveth faintly, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be honored, but they&#x2019;ll never&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know what you&#x2019;re thinking,&#x201d; interrupted the president, wagging a finger at her. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Miss Breck, I wouldn&#x2019;t be making this offer if the college wasn&#x2019;t willing to accept you. I know you come from humble stock and your family&#x2019;s had more than its share of troubles, but to my mind that just proves what a resourceful young lady you are. That&#x2019;s the sort of brain I want working for my company, the kind of boldness and sharp thinking that will give Glow-Mor the edge!&#x201d;<br> <br>His confidence was buoyant, and Isaveth&#x2019;s hopes rose with it. Maybe this wasn&#x2019;t a mistake after all. Maybe this was what she&#x2019;d been praying for ever since Mama died and Papa lost his business, a chance to make something of herself and lift her family out of poverty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Except for one hard fact, dragging her back to earth like an iron anchor. If she&#x2019;d merely been poor, then Mister Wregget&#x2019;s offer might be seen as an act of charity, a way to enhance his company&#x2019;s good name. But as far as most people in Tarreton were concerned, Isaveth was much worse off than that.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s kind of you to say so,&#x201d; she said, forcing the words past the lump in her throat. &#x201c;Only you don&#x2019;t seem to realize&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;m Moshite.&#x201d;<br> <br>Even as she spoke, she braced herself for his reaction: the hiss of breath, the lowering brows, the frown. But to her surprise, Wregget threw back his head and laughed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Honest to a fault, Miss Breck! I see I haven&#x2019;t misjudged you.&#x201d; He folded his hands across his belly, still smiling. &#x201c;True enough, your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. er&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. religious background did raise a few eyebrows among the masters. But as Spellmistress Anandri pointed out, there&#x2019;s nothing in the college charter to prevent Moshites from attending. As long as you work hard, obey school rules, and pass your exams, they&#x2019;ve got no right to turn you away.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isaveth had only met Spellmistress Anandri once, and only because her friend Quiz&#x2014;otherwise known as Esmond Lilord, youngest son of the Sagelord himself&#x2014;introduced them. Still, the woman had seemed impressed with Isaveth&#x2019;s skill at Common Magic, and even helped bring her magic-resistant paper to Wregget&#x2019;s attention. With such a respected member of the college on her side, perhaps Isaveth&#x2019;s acceptance wasn&#x2019;t as unlikely as she&#x2019;d thought.<br> <br>Still, just because the school had no grounds to refuse her didn&#x2019;t mean Isaveth belonged there. She might not even be safe, if anyone recognized her from her last visit, when she&#x2019;d posed as a cleaning maid to investigate the old governor&#x2019;s murder.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Especially since the current governor of the school, Hexter Buldage, had been part of the conspiracy to kill him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can see you have doubts,&#x201d; said Wregget, &#x201c;and I can&#x2019;t say I blame you. I&#x2019;m sure it all sounds a bit too good to be true. But I&#x2019;ll tell you a secret.&#x201d; He leaned closer, voice dropping to a confidential rumble. &#x201c;Buying that recipe of yours was the best decision I&#x2019;ve ever made. Thanks to Resisto-Paper, we&#x2019;ve become the leading spell-tablet manufacturer in the city, and orders are pouring in from all over Colonia. You&#x2019;ve earned that scholarship, is what I say, and anyone who thinks otherwise will have to deal with me!&#x201d; His hand smacked the desk, making Isaveth jump. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s your answer, young lady?&#x201d;<br> <br>Isaveth twisted her hands together. Yes, going to Tarreton College would be risky. There were plenty of people, including Esmond&#x2019;s villainous older brother, Eryx Lording, who wouldn&#x2019;t want her to succeed. If Isaveth failed, she&#x2019;d not only bring disgrace on her family, she&#x2019;d be confirming what most Arcan and Uniting folk already believed&#x2014;that Moshites were worthless troublemakers, and everything bad that happened to them was their own fault.<br> <br>Yet she wouldn&#x2019;t be alone at the college: Esmond would be there too. Isaveth still wasn&#x2019;t sure how to feel about the charming rogue of a street-boy she&#x2019;d befriended four months ago turning out to be a noble in disguise, especially since they couldn&#x2019;t spend time together anymore without causing a scandal. But at least she&#x2019;d be able to see him now and then, instead of only writing letters.<br> <br>Besides, she wanted this. Inside her, beneath the worries and doubts, lay a simmering excitement ready to bubble over at any moment. To face the odds and defy them, to bravely march into danger instead of shying away&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t that what her favorite talkie-play heroine, Auradia Champion, would do? There was no guarantee Isaveth would succeed at the college, but if she didn&#x2019;t at least try, she&#x2019;d regret it for the rest of her life.<br> <br>Isaveth took a deep breath and smiled at Wregget. &#x201c;Thank you, sir. I&#x2019;d love to accept.&#x201d;<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Dear Isaveth, I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;ve got bad news.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Esmond rubbed his forehead, staring at the freshly penned words. How was he going to tell her? He was still struggling to get over the shock and disappointment himself. All those weeks spent hunting for the evidence that would prove Eryx guilty of murder, and now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>A throat cleared behind him, and Esmond jumped. He flipped the paper over, though he had a sick feeling Eryx had already seen it, and twisted in his chair. &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; he snapped.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mother sent me to call you to supper.&#x201d; As always, his older brother&#x2019;s voice was rich, mellow, and maddeningly calm. &#x201c;The bell rang five minutes ago, but it seems you were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. distracted.&#x201d;<br> <br>He&#x2019;d come up on Esmond&#x2019;s blind side, and not by mistake: the illusion-charmed lens Esmond usually wore lay unheeded beside the ink blotter, and the scar that ran from brow to cheekbone was plain to see. Not that Eryx would be likely to forget which eye had been injured, seeing as he was the one who&#x2019;d done it.<br> <br>Inwardly Esmond seethed, but he kept his expression neutral as he studied the young man who&#x2019;d made himself the most trusted politician in the city, even as he secretly bribed, blackmailed, and&#x2014;if necessary&#x2014;murdered anyone who dared to get in his way. Eryx Lording, Sagelord Arvis&#x2019;s favorite son&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and for all that they both pretended otherwise, Esmond&#x2019;s most bitter enemy.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not hungry,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Eryx&#x2019;s brows arched. &#x201c;Considering your usual rampaging appetite, I find that difficult to believe. To whom were you writing, may I ask? Surely not that Breck girl. I thought we had an agreement.&#x201d;<br> <br>He hadn&#x2019;t read the letter, then. Or maybe he had, and he was just toying with Esmond. With Eryx, you could never tell.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you know,&#x201d; said Esmond, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been thinking about that. You already burned my street clothes, and Father made me charm-swear not to dress up like a commoner or sneak out of the house again. Then you warned me that if I tried to see Isaveth, you&#x2019;d have your thugs pay her family a visit&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thugs?&#x201d; Eryx gave him a pitying look. &#x201c;Really, Esmond, you sound like that ridiculous Auradia show you love so much. I merely remarked that after all Urias Breck had been through since he was arrested, and how hard young Isaveth had worked to clear his name, it would be a shame if they had to endure any further misfortunes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, quite,&#x201d; said Esmond. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve lost whole seconds of sleep worrying over it. But it&#x2019;s occurred to me that you could have kept me in line more easily by telling Father about Isaveth, instead of making vague remarks about me &#x2018;keeping low company&#x2019; and &#x2018;disgracing the family name.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>He cocked his head to one side, studying Eryx through his good eye. &#x201c;Only you don&#x2019;t want to tell him, do you? Because that would mean admitting you botched up, and Urias Breck&#x2019;s daughter caught you framing her papa for a murder you helped commit.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eryx sighed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve talked about these delusions of yours before, Esmond. Is there a point to this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe not,&#x201d; said Esmond. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s an interesting thought. After all, if I&#x2019;m not allowed to talk to Isaveth anyway, what&#x2019;s to keep me from telling Father the whole story?&#x201d;<br> <br>Eryx regarded him steadily for a moment. Then he snatched up Esmond&#x2019;s sheet of writing paper, crumpled it, and tossed it into the fire. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;d find that less satisfying than you imagine,&#x201d; he said coolly. &#x201c;Remember what happened the last time you accused me in front of Father?&#x201d;<br> <br>A dull heat spread beneath Esmond&#x2019;s collarbones. He wouldn&#x2019;t soon forget the agony of Eryx&#x2019;s fencing sword lashing his eye, or the keener torment when Esmond realized that no one&#x2014;not his mother, not the Sagelord, not even his sister Civilla&#x2014;was prepared to believe it had been anything more than an accident.<br> <br>That was the curse of having a silver-tongued demon for a brother. If it came to his word against Esmond&#x2019;s, Eryx would always win.<br> <br>&#x201c;In any case,&#x201d; Eryx went on, &#x201c;if you want to sulk over missing your girlfriend, that&#x2019;s your business. But you know how Mother feels about family dinners. You wouldn&#x2019;t want to upset Mother, would you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Esmond was tempted to treat that question with the scorn it deserved. Lady Nessa&#x2019;s fragile nerves were notorious: She&#x2019;d always be anxious about something, whether her youngest son came to dinner or not. But Lord Arvis was also waiting, and defying him was another matter.<br> <br>Grudgingly Esmond picked up his half glass, hooked it into place, and rose. He was taller than his brother when they stood side by side, but Eryx didn&#x2019;t allow him that satisfaction; he turned and strode out, leaving Esmond to trail after him like a servant&#x2014;or a dog.<br> <br>Dear Isaveth:<br> <br>I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;m a stinking failure as a detective, which means the men who killed Governor Orien and nearly got your papa hanged for it are never going to pay. Also, Eryx caught me writing to you, and if he tells Father I&#x2019;ve been &#x201c;fraternizing with commoners&#x201d; again I won&#x2019;t have to worry about his dodgy liver&#x2014;he&#x2019;ll die of apoplexy instead.<br> <br>But that was black humor, and self-pitying besides, and Isaveth wouldn&#x2019;t think much of either. She&#x2019;d watched her mother die of a wasting illness and her father get dragged off to jail, and it had only made her more determined to stand up for justice and protect the people she loved. Esmond&#x2019;s family might not need him&#x2014;or even care about him&#x2014;the way that Isaveth&#x2019;s did, but he could do better than that.<br> <br>Dear Isaveth:<br> <br>I&#x2019;m afraid we&#x2019;ve had a bit of a setback, and by &#x201c;a bit&#x201d; I mean &#x201c;I just found the only evidence we had against Eryx burned and smashed to bits,&#x201d; which is the opposite of what I&#x2019;d hoped to tell you. But I haven&#x2019;t forgotten what my brother did to your family, and I promise that somehow, I&#x2019;ll make him pay for it. Don&#x2019;t lose heart.<br> <br>P.S. Have you decided if I can kiss you yet?<br> <br>That was better. More like Quiz, the jaunty street-boy he&#x2019;d pretended to be when he first met Isaveth, the bold and funny part of him that she liked best. Even if the last thing he&#x2019;d said to her had been so embarrassing that he could only recover by turning it into a joke, they were still friends and he hoped to keep it that way.<br> <br>For now, though, writing Isaveth was out...</p><h2>A Religious History of the American People</h2><p>Provides a comprehensive survey of religious beliefs, practices, and trends in America</p><p></p><h2>The Original Christmas Gift</h2><p>Here is a book that addresses the hard questions about what really happened that first Christmas in Bethlehem. For many people Christmas is a fable or legend enjoyed by children. For others it is a secular holiday and a time for parties and family reunions. The truth is that it is a celebration of a great miracle of God. It is about the birth of one who literally had no beginning and existed from all eternity in heaven. The author shows that this unique birth was quite natural but that the conception of the baby Jesus was supernatural. God's Spirit "overshadowed" Mary and prevented her from passing any sin to the child in her womb. The birth of Christ was part of an eternal plan in the mind of God and clues concerning it are found throughout the Old Testament. Some of these are described. The author also goes on to interpret the meaning of Jesus' own words about his coming into the world. <p>Most of us know the familiar story about Joseph, Mary, the angels and shepherds and wisemen but what about the rest of the cast? All of the characters become real people in this book as you learn their background and the roles they play in the story. </p><p>One chapter asks, "What difference does it make?" You will learn that because Jesus came we no longer need to wonder about the character of God. We learn that He is always aware of our situation and concerned for our welfare. He knows from having lived among us what it means to be human. </p><p>God, of course, is not Santa Claus. We cannot earn or deserve God's approval. Our motivation for being good and doing good is not to get a reward but to thank Him for the undeserved gift of His love and forgiveness. </p><p>The book has a concluding chapter on "The Other Nativity." The author means that as with any gift it takes one to give and one to receive. We can receive this gift as we recognize our need of Christ, and invite him to take control of our hearts and minds. We remember the carol: "O holy child of Bethlehem, descend to us, we pray. Cast out our sin and enter in, be born in us today." Just as we were born physically into our parents' home, God also wants to give us a second birth in His special family of believers. All this is made possible by Christ's coming that first Christmas. No wonder the apostle Paul, pondering it, said it was an "indescribable gift." (2 Cor. 9:15)</p></p><p>Albert S. Lawrence, Jr. is a retired Episcopal minister living in Houston, Texas.

They are small enough to simply produce a warm glow and dramatic enough to create awe and wonder.A father of five witnesses his burning home being saved by bearded strangers with fire extinguishers, who put out the fire and then disappear. A diamond miner in South Africa barely avoids a deadly crash when he is pushed out of a packed elevator at the last minute. A chance meeting leads a woman to the apartment of her closest childhood friend, now dying of AIDS. She helps her friend regain spiritual strength and becomes a surrogate mother to her friend's child.If we allow ourselves to look beyond the glow and focus on the wonder, we will recognize that, in moments such as these, we are in the presence of God.</p><p>William G.

Simultaneous.</p><p>The Haggadah, a prayer book that commemorates the ancient tale of Jews fleeing from slavery in Egypt is the inspiration for this handsomely illustrated, well-researched volume that describes the customs surrounding the religious observance of Passover and suggests ways to give children an important part in the celebration. The author explains every aspect of the holiday; from the way the house is cleaned and prepared, to setting the Seder table, the order of the service, selected recipes, table decorations, and the meanings of the prayers. Traditional prayers in Hebrew, English translation, and transliteration as well as verse sung to familiar tunes such as Sing a Song of Sixpence have a place in this Haggadah. Stories, poems, songs, and music, a play about the Exodus and discussion questions help children and adults explore the meaning of Passover. Customs from different parts of the world and gender-neutral translations of the Hebrew text make the book accessible to people of varied backgrounds. Adults are the likely users; dipping into it to understand various aspects of the holiday celebration; reading passages aloud; selecting portions for the family Seder. Children will love the illustrations. A beautifully designed resource with a wealth of material for the family that wants to construct its own child-centered Passover celebration. (Nonfiction. All ages) -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Teaming their considerable talents, Musleah and August offer a stop-and-take-notice version of the book used to lead families through the seder, the home service, and the festive meal that opens the eight-day Passover celebration. Subtle reminders of the holiday's celebration of freedom are enfolded into Musleah's poetic explanations of the symbolic foods and traditions, as well as questions that encourage participation in the celebration. The Hebrew prayers are gender neutral and written with transliterations and English translations so everyone can be involved in the service. The scores and lyrics of traditional songs, as well as illuminating comments about their meanings, are included, and songs set to melodies such as "Yankee Doodle," add a lighthearted touch for children. There are also folk stories and a brief, four-act play. August's jubilant, signature linocuts, printed in oils on rice paper, bloom in the colors and stylized images of spring and the Middle East's flowers and fruits. Their luminous colors and rich textures lend a radiance to the majestic depiction of the seder plate and wrap the images of God's intervention to free the Israelites in spirituality. The vibrant writing and artistic creativity of this memorable collaboration vitalize an ancient Jewish tradition for contemporary children. <i>Ellen Mandel</i></p><h2>The Icicle Imps (Sophie and the Shadow Woods)</h2><p>Each book in this series sees Sophie having to outwit weird and terrifying creatures from the Shadow Woods, and in this 5th adventure, it&#39;s the turn of the nasty icicle imps!

Amid the shrines and temples of Rome, the Romans sought to preserve and strengthen a religion especially suited to the ambitious city. But Roman religion had also proved permeable to many influences, from Greece, Egypt, Persia, and other parts of Italy. What then was truly Roman, and what had Romans done with their borrowings to stamp them with Roman character? </p><p>By exhaustive study of texts, inscriptions, and archaeology of Roman sacred places, Dumezil traces the formation of archaic Roman religion from Indo-European sources through the development of the rites and beliefs of the Roman republic. He describes a religion that was not only influenced by the other religions with which it came into contact, but influenced them as well, in mutual efforts to distinguish one nation from another. Even so, certain continuities were sustained in order to achieve a religion that crossed generations and ways of life. The worship of certain gods became the special concerns of certain parts of society, all of which needed attention to assure Rome's success in war, civil administration, and the production of food and goods.</p></p><p><p>By exhaustive study of texts, inscriptions, and archaeology of Roman sacred places, Dumezil traces the formation of archaic Roman religion from Indo-European sources through the development of the rites and beliefs of the Roman republic.

Hancock points to the intriguing possibility that ancient Martian civilization is communicating with us through the remarkable structures it left behind.<br><br>In exploring the possible traces left by the Martian civilization and the cosmic cataclysm that may have ended it, <b>The Mars Mystery</b> is both an illumination of our ancient past and a warning--that we still have time to heed--about our ultimate fate.</p><p>Mars holds a special fascination for us, because it is the most Earth-like planet we've yet encountered. As we continue to explore the red planet, geological evidence mounts that long ago water flowed freely across its surface, begging the question: If there was water, was there life? Graham Hancock thinks so. In fact, Hancock, a former journalist and the author of several books, including <i>Fingerprints of the Gods</i>, believes that certain formations on the Martian surface are the remnants of an ancient civilization--one strikingly similar to ancient Egypt--that was destroyed by a cataclysmic deep impact. Further, Hancock claims that NASA's reluctance to give credence to "The Face," "The Pyramids," and other things people see in images of the Martian surface is evidence that the U.S. space agency is motivated by cold war paranoia and mistrust. Hancock seems to be more fair-minded than many NASA critics, stating that, "what we see is a mindset, here, not a conspiracy." And indeed, one is hard-pressed to imagine why NASA isn't agreeing wholeheartedly with Hancock, since his ultimate point is that we should be paying more attention to our planetary neighbors and the skies above, lest we suffer the same fate as the Martians. Hancock raises many intriguing questions in this synthesis of unorthodox Mars theory, but those looking for applications of Ockham's razor had best search elsewhere--Hancock's theories require a leap of faith as surely as NASA's do. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>Graham Hancock has traveled around the world writing books and filming movies on archaeological discoveries and their connection to our distant past. He is the author of the best-selling Fingerprints of the Gods and The Sign and the Seal.</p><h2>Patenting the Sun: Polio and the Salk Vaccine</h2><p>Chronicles Dr. Salk&#39;s successful efforts to develop and test a vaccine for polio, from a small laboratory experiment to the first and largest national vaccination campaign</p><p>Paralytic polio went from epidemic outbreak to near-extinction in 50 years. This medical triumph involved more than the daring of Jonas Salk, who developed a killer-virus vaccine against the advice of his colleagues, and of his rival Albert Sabin, whose oral live-virus vaccine is now widely used. The war on polio is also the story of the March of Dimes, mass field-testing of the vaccine on schoolchildren, accidental deaths, scientists jockeying for prestige and power, and the importation of large numbers of monkeys. A Northwestern University visiting scholar, Smith unconvincingly links FDR's struggle with crippling polio to the nation's turning "to the language of polio" in the 1930s ("Business was 'paralyzed,' the economy was 'crippled' "). Her contention that the 1950s vaccination program drew popular support from the Cold War's "atmosphere of mass vulnerability" seems dubious, as do some of her sociological interpretations. Even so, this exciting, dramatic narrative tells a comprehensive story of the conquest of polio and sheds fresh light on the politics of medicine. Photos.

Various and sundry relatives and friends also tag along. Their collective mission is to rescue Little Hawk's sister, Renna, and her husband, Beau, a count and younger brother of the future king Louis Philippe. Renna and her spouse have been caught in Portugal, where the count has been sent on a diplomatic mission, when Napoleon invades the Iberian Peninsula.

Foxes are hunted. Banquets are attended. Indian ceremonies are enacted. Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson are but two of the historical personages who appear.

Light snow fell from the sky, covering my brown fur with white. My mother&#x2019;s tongue washed over me and warmed my skin. Soon she nudged me, urging me to stand.<br><i>Rise, </i>she told me. <i>Danger can hide in the dark woods.<br></i>I scrambled to my feet. My long legs were sturdy, my body stout. I nursed, and my mother&#x2019;s milk gave me strength. I hopped in the snow, trying out my legs. Mother smiled proudly as I trotted and leaped. Soon I grew weary. Mother led me into the shed, and sinking onto a soft pile of hay, I slept.<br>Morning came, and the rising sun broke through the clouds. As soon as it was light, my mother began to teach me.<br><i>There is so much to learn, </i>she told me. I followed her around the paddock. She touched her nose to all the new things: <i>fence,</i> <i>tree, water trough, hay, mud.</i><br><i>Mud </i>I learned quickly. As the snow melted, my tiny hooves sank into the sloppy brown mess. I was scrambling onto a dry stump when a fluttering sound startled me.<br>A bright blue creature landed on the fence. I tensed. <i>Is this danger? </i>I asked my mother.<br>Her muzzle twitched in laughter. <i>No, my son. That is a blue jay. They are pesky and steal my corn, but they are not danger.<br></i>Jumping off the stump, I whinnied to the blue jay. It flew into the trees.<br><i>Blue jays have wings, </i>my mother explained. <i>They are free to fly to wherever they want.</i><br>I peered between the fence rails. I wanted to race after the blue jay to the place called <i>wherever they want. </i>The blue jay had disappeared, but outside the paddock were many more new things to explore!<br>I touched my nose to the railing, but the fence circled my mother and me, penning us in. I checked my back. Did I have wings? All I saw was brown hair.<br><i>If only I had wings, </i>I thought. <i>I could fly free, too.<br></i>Suddenly a shriek filled the air. I fled behind my mother. I flicked my fuzzy ears.<br><i>Danger? </i>Turning, I peeked from beneath her thick black tail.<br>A creature leaped over the top railing, landing with a splash in the mud. It was as colorful and noisy as the blue jay, only bigger!<br>Wings spread wide, it hurtled toward me. Terrified, I turned to run, but my long legs tangled. I fell in a heap. Mud splattered my white star. The giant blue jay plopped on the ground next to me. Its wings wrapped tightly around my neck, and I was trapped!<br><i>Mother, </i>I neighed. <i>Danger!<br></i>But my mother&#x2019;s eyes were twinkling.<br>&#x201c;Papa! Bell had her foal!&#x201d; the blue jay cried out.<br>&#x201c;I see, Miss Katie,&#x201d; an even taller blue jay answered. &#x201c;But, daughter, your joy is scaring him. Let him go so we can see how fine he is.&#x201d;<br>The wings released me. I scrambled to my hooves and rushed to the far side of the paddock. My mother hurried after me and blew into my nostrils.<br><i>Do not be afraid. Those are humans. The large one is Papa. The small one is Katie. They feed and care for us. In return, we work for them.<br>Work. </i>I did not know that word yet. My mother pushed me forward. My legs splayed, refusing to move. The human called Papa set a wooden bucket in the paddock.<br>&#x201c;Come, Bell,&#x201d; he called. My mother trotted over. Dipping her head, she ate hungrily.<br>&#x201c;You have given us a fine fellow, Bell,&#x201d; Papa said, patting her neck.<br>Wide-eyed and trembling, I stared at the human called Katie. She stood in the middle of the paddock, her eyes as curious as mine.<br>Then she held out one wing. This time she walked quietly to me. Her wings were soft when they stole around my neck. Then her cheek pressed against mine, and my trembling stopped.<br>&#x201c;He has a white star, just like Bell,&#x201d; Katie said. &#x201c;And look, two white legs.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a fine-looking Morgan horse. Strong like his dam. Handsome like his sire,&#x201d; Papa said. &#x201c;Soon he&#x2019;ll be able to pull the plow and the carriage.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Papa, may I name him?&#x201d; Katie asked. He nodded. <br>&#x201c;I name him Bell&#x2019;s Star.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a grand name for such a small foal,&#x201d; Papa said.<br>&#x201c;One day he <i>will </i>be grand, I know,&#x201d; Katie said, scratching my fuzzy mane. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll lead the St. Albans parade like Mr. Jones&#x2019;s Morgan horse.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope he grows up to be as grand a worker as Bell,&#x201d; Papa said. &#x201c;Our farm needs a Morgan that can pull a plow, not lead a parade.&#x201d;<br>I nuzzled Katie&#x2019;s arm. I didn&#x2019;t know <i>grand </i>or <i>parade, </i>but I wanted to show her I no<i> </i>longer thought she was <i>danger.<br></i>&#x201c;Oh, Papa,&#x201d; Katie sighed, her breath tickling my whiskers. &#x201c;I love him already.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll give Bell a day of rest,&#x201d; Papa said. &#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s back to work tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><i>Work. </i>There was that word again.

Miriam is a baker whose bread is full of smells to make your nose twitch and tastes to make your tongue tingle. Miriam&#39;s own favorite cinnamon bread so delights Sebastian, a musician who enters her shop, that he buys it every day for a year and then asks her to marry him. After a baby is born to the happy couple, all is blissful until their bundle of joy begins crying. And crying. Only when the two are almost at wit&#39;s end does Miriam suddenly know, looking down at her baby curled up like a little raisin, exactly what she must do. A celebration of the bond between mother and child and an ode to the power of our senses, each delectable word and image of this beautifully told and illustrated story will be savored.</p><p>Nicola Winstanley has always loved to write; but it wasn&#39;t until her daughter was born that she started writing stories for children. Nicola considers herself lucky because she gets to read children&#39;s books all the time ? it&#39;s the best part of the day for her. She&#39;s also lucky because she gets to read fledgling writers, as she teaches writing to students at Humber College in Toronto.Miriam the baker is beloved in her village. Every day she bicycles to work and saves her favorite cinnamon bread for last, singing as she kneads spices into the dough. The scents and songs attract fellow bicyclist Sebastian, and he falls head over handlebars for Miriam. After marrying, their domestic bliss is disrupted when their beautiful new baby begins to cry continuously. What finally placates the fussy infant? The sounds and smells of Miriam making a batch of cinnamon bread. Winstanleys text ends abruptly, but both the words and pictures engage the senses in a heady, tangled mix: Miriam has a sweet-smelling voice, while in the winsome collage illustrations, her songs and the scent of her bread intertwine in ribbons decorated with hearts and notes as violin-playing cats stroll the streets. Many children will welcome the beside-the-point depiction of a multicultural family: Miriam is paper white, Sebastian is cocoa brown, and their cinnamon-colored child gives the title a sly double meaning. A charming offering infused with warmth, romantic whimsy, and love.

Michelle's brief affair with Denny enraged a jealous Cass, and led to John's temporarily kicking Michelle out of the band.

Our actions? Our motivations? Can we look into the make-up of the universe and apply it to who we are and what we do? The answers to these questions are to be found in the new science of socionomics. <p>Socionomics evolved from the Wave Principle, a theory of patterns in financial markets. Now Robert Prechter proposes that this very same principle can be applied to our own social and cultural lives. Prechter shows that dominant aspects of our unconscious mentation are characterized by measurable patterns. Those patterns form the building blocks of humankind's social interaction, and in turn, the Wave Principle. </p><p>"WOW stuff! Prechter is doing the most creative work that I have seen in my career on Wall Street." �&#x2013;John R. Greeley, professional market analyst, co-founder, Market Technicians Association "Spectacular. I was absolutely impressed. A most brilliant work." �&#x2013;David Johnson, PhD, MD </p><p>"Congratulations to Robert Prechter for his interesting, insightful and trail-blazing work. Anyone willing to take the time to read this volume will be rewarded with a new understanding of human behavior, markets and events." �&#x2013;Tom Spradley, retired college mathematics professor </p><p>"Learning about socionomics has proven to be one of those rare intellectual epiphanies that results in an absolute change in the direction of my life. So much about the human experience that had mystified me all of my adult life seems so clear now, so understandable �&#x2013; even to the point of being predictable." �&#x2013;Jack Hobson-Dupont, President, Monadyne Corp. </p><p>"I love this theory. Socionomics is sure to be a primary reference source for quite some time. The volume and value of analysis that Prechter has conducted is something hard to over-appreciate. There should be university courses and degrees in the science of socionomics and perhaps Nobel Prize winners as well. I recommend many readings of the book to appreciate it in depth." Professor Valeri Safonov, PhD, former First Secretary of Ministry of External Affairs of USSR and economist with the Russian Embassies in Canada and India</p></p><p>Comments from the Author: Robert R. Prechter, Jr. <p>The social sciences today are where the physical sciences were three hundred years ago: on the verge of a revolution. Ralph Nelson Elliott discovered that social mood, impelled by an unconscious herding impulse, fluctuates in a recognizable pattern reflecting a natural growth principle, which he called the Wave Principle. Socionomics is the study of these patterns and their effects, i.e., social action and the events of history. Because it has a mathematical base, the Wave Principle is to sociology what Newton&#x2019;s laws were to physics. It provides a basis and framework within which to study and quantify social behavior and thus serves as an anchor for the undertaking of true social science.</p>Author Bio: Robert R. Prechter, Jr. <p>Robert R. Prechter, Jr. has achieved worldwide fame as an author, investment analyst, businessman and social commentator. In 1978, he co-authored with A.J. Frost Elliott Wave Principle: Key to Market Behavior. The book sold more than 300,000 copies and became a Wall Street Best Seller. Three other books have followed, all of them achieving similar success. In addition to his books, he is the editor of the Elliott Wave Theorist, an award-winning newsletter that has enjoyed immense popularity in its 20 years of publication. In 1984, Prechter disproved any doubters that the Elliott Wave Principle was a window to financial opportunity when he set an all-time record in the United States Trading Championship. Using the Wave Principle as his only method of analysis, he returned 444.4% in a monitored, real-money options account in the four-month contest period. His success did not go unnoticed, and in December 1989, Financial News Network named him, �&#x201c;Guru of the Decade.�&#x201d; A flood of radio, television, and written interviews followed, including the cover of Time Magazine and Fortune. On the heels of this success, he founded Elliott Wave International, a successful technical investment analysis company located near Atlanta, Ga. Now, after years researching and studying the psychology and science behind the Wave Principle, Prechter delves deeper than ever before into the reasons for its existence and its universal implications. In his most recent book, The Wave Principle of Human Social Behavior he formulates his theories into a new branch of science he calls �&#x201c;socionomics.�&#x201d; The book is being hailed as a tremendous success by both general readers and academic scholars.</p></p><h2>Historical Atlas of the American West</h2><p><p>The enduring image evoked by the American West is one of grand physical and historical romance, spectacle, and drama. Many generations of historians, both popular and academic, have sought to communication the unique characteristics of this region, whose history and physical setting have for so long captured the public imagination. In the <em>Historical Atlas of the American West</em>, a historian and a geographer meet this challenge by telling the story of the region from a comprehensive geographical perspective. Defining the American West as the seventeen contiguous states from the one-hundredth meridian westward (Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, California, Oregon, and Washington), Warren A. Beck and Ynez D. Haase provide seventy-eight maps, each with explanatory text and a selective bibliography of further readings.</p> <p>This atlas presents the history of the West from prehistoric times to the present. The physical characteristics of the region&#x2015;its natural resources and geographic features, climatic zones, agricultural regions, mineral resources, and native flora fauna&#x2015;are presented, along with special maps stressing the impact of natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and the eruption of Mount St. Helens.</p> <p>Several maps provide unique views of Western Indians from ancient times to the latter part of the nineteenth century, including maps devoted to the tragedy at Wounded Knee, the Ghost Dance Religion, and Indian judicial districts. All the major explorations and overland movements in the region, as well as the evolution of transportation routes&#x2015;from cattle trails to modern railroads&#x2015;are depicted. The Spanish-Mexican land grants are presented in detail, with special emphasis on the early ranchos of Texas. Locations of important military events and installations, ranging from the Indian Wars of West to World War II POW camps, are recorded.</p> <p>Beck and Haase have thus succeeded in synthesizing and capsulizing a vast amount of information on the American West to create seventy-eight vignettes of uniquely western events and life ways from 1536 to 1980. Offering insights into the region&#x2019;s geography and the various groups that have populated the West over the centuries, this atlas will provide a valuable reference for scholars and fascinating entertainment for Western history buffs.</p></p><p><p><strong>Warren A.

The confusion, fear, and suffering of The People are drawn with clarity and immediacy. A factual afterword gives a larger picture of the times with captioned period photographs of the Navajo. The story is rich with details of Native life gracefully woven into the telling of events. Characterizations are complete, even for minor participants. The publication information is at the rear of the book, as it is for all titles in this series, which has given rise to a general criticism that the stories are easily mistaken for actual period diaries. The CIP classification is 813.54; granted, that is American fiction, but placing this book in the nonfiction section of the library only adds to the confusion. The author's comments allow readers to believe that Sarah Nita was a real girl ("born in 1851"). All the same, it is a compelling story, and its power will attract readers.<br><i>Cris Riedel, Ellis B.

Fresh insight is provided regarding such questions as: Whatever happened to Daniel&#39;s tomb? Is Michael &#34;one of the chief princes&#34; or is he &#34;the first of the chief princes&#34;? Why did King Nebuchadnezzar forget his dream? Why did Daniel undertake his three-week fast during Passover? Author Jacques Doukhan re-creates the staggering world of Babylon, explains obscure allusions, and finds hidden patterns within the prophesies that help to clarify their meaning. His research in ancient Jewish sources and knowledge of the original languages makes this book a worthy contribution to your prophecy library. Want to understand the book of Daniel better than ever?

By changing the focus from outside to inside the person, Bergmann shows how freedom can be a reality in self-growth, parenting, education, and in shaping a society that stimulates rather than stunts the self.</p><p>Frithjof Bergmann is professor emeritus of philosophy at the University of Michigan.&#x201c;<i>A breath of fresh air<i>. Not only does Bergmann give good reasons why standard contemporary philosophical views on freedom are fundamentally off base, but he also displays why current educational disputes over regimented vs. permissive education, and political debates over regulated vs. unregulated society, are grounded in irrelevant and confused notions of freedom. The book is brilliant and terribly exciting.&#x201d; (Frederick Suppe)</i></i></p><h2>Insect Dreams: The Half Life of Gregor Samsa</h2><p>A hilarious novel filled with cultural history, musical theory, nuclear physics, and a world of ideas follows Gregor Samsa, who, having metamorphosed into a cockroach, is sold into a Viennese sideshow by his chambermaid, where he lectures carnival crowds on the implications of Rilke and Herr Spengler, and over the course of thirty years and two continents, discovers the true meaning of his existence. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>Marc Estrin is a writer, cellist, and activist.The hapless antihero who morphed into a cockroach in Kafka's Metamorphosis is resurrected and given a rather busy second life in Estrin's brilliantly conceived but erratic debut novel. In Estrin's version, Gregor Samsa is sold to a Viennese sideshow rather than being swept into the trash, and he quickly becomes the major attraction in entrepreneur Amadeus Hoffnung's bizarre little circus. The author keeps his early incarnation of Samsa reasonably close to Kafka's character, and he even adds a cheeky chapter in which Samsa meets Ludwig Wittgenstein. But when the circus subplot runs its course and Samsa goes off to New York, he undergoes a radical transformation into a half-man, half-insect superhero whom the author uses to reexamine the first half of the 20th century, with Samsa working behind the scenes as a liaison in the worlds of science, music, business and politics to push pivotal historical events in the right direction. His encounters with Charles Ives, FDR, Einstein and Oppenheimer, among others, are rendered with a combination of humor, chutzpah and intelligence. Even though Estrin has a tendency to go over the top, he succeeds at many levels in his recreation of one of Kafka's most memorable characters, redrawing Samsa as a compassionate, brilliant bug. The book's many excesses don't detract from the scope of its premise and the kaleidoscopic dazzle of its most successful episodes. Agent, Dorian Karchmar. (Jan.)Forecast: The whimsical jacket art and the tie to Kafka should catch the eye of a brainy subgroup of readers; the lively prose will keep them hooked. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>No Truce With the Furies</h2><p>A fearless exploration of the mysteries of life and death, this is the author&#39;s most powerful work in his old age.</p><p>R.S Thomas (1913-2000) published over 50 books of poetry and prose.

Keane (Keane, John B.)</h2><p>This bountiful, first-time-ever omnibus collection of more than fifty tales by one of Ireland&#39;s liveliest and most popular story writers offers holiday charm, human idiosyncrasy, and Gaelic humor by the Christmas stockingful. Drawing on the rich folk culture of County Kerry, John B. Keane brings new life to old custom in his portrayals of the special holiday dreams and everyday shortcomings of not-so-ordinary country people during the Christmas season. At the same time that he revels in the charms and eccentricities of the Irish, Keane also exposes the fallible souls that lie behind them. With enough good cheer to warm the heart throughout the holiday season and the long nights of winter, Keane&#39;s congenial volume revisits the Christmases celebrated by characters like Dotie Tupper and Johnny Naile, the doughty Canon Doyle and deaf Canon Cornelius Coodle, the amiable spendthrift Aenias Mackson and Hiccups O&#39;Reilly, who disappears one Christmas Eve for seven years.

Beiswanger, Monticello's Robert H. Smith Director of Restoration. He shares his intimate knowledge of Jefferson's home gained over nearly three decades and reveals his own affection for this historic house. Beiswanger describes Jefferson's struggle to find harmony between the classical system of architectural proportion and his own "law of convenience." He also comments on renowned features such as the narrow stairs and the "conveniences"--indoor privies, and automatic door to the parlor, a revolving serving door--that America's third president incorporated in the design of his home. Stories from guests' and family members' experiences at Monticello during Jefferson's lifetime enliven the book.</p><p></p></p><p>William L.

This new book, City of Revelation, will be even more controversial, for it presents evidence for the view that earlier civilizations understood better than our own the natural laws controlling seasons, human behavior, and the most subtle relationships between the whole of the universe and its parts. These relationships, says Michell, are analogues of harmonic relationships in music and of the elegant geometry of the ancients. They are preserved, as he demonstrates, in the forms of the great temples of man-the cathedral at chartres, Stonehenge, St. Mary&#39;s Chapel at Glastonbury, the Great Pyramid, the Temple in Jerusalem, and others. This proposition will no doubt be attacked by more conventional representatives of archeology and anthropology. The reader will judge for himself if he accepts Mr. Mitchell&#39;s invitation to study the evidence put forward and the clues to the constitution of the cosmic canon.</p><p></p><h2>Raymie Nightingale</h2><p>Two-time Newbery Medalist Kate DiCamillo returns to her roots with a moving, masterful story of an unforgettable summer friendship. <br>Raymie Clarke has come to realize that everything, absolutely everything, depends on her. And she has a plan. If Raymie can win the Little Miss Central Florida Tire competition, then her father, who left town two days ago with a dental hygienist, will see Raymie's picture in the paper and (maybe) come home. To win, not only does Raymie have to do good deeds and learn how to twirl a baton; she also has to contend with the wispy, frequently fainting Louisiana Elefante, who has a show-business background, and the fiery, stubborn Beverly Tapinski, who s determined to sabotage the contest. But as the competition approaches, loneliness, loss, and unanswerable questions draw the three girls into an unlikely friendship and challenge each of them to come to the rescue in unexpected ways."</p><p>Kate DiCamillo is one of America s most beloved storytellers. She is the National Ambassador for Young People s Literature and a two-time Newbery Medalist. Born in Philadelphia, she grew up in Florida and now lives in Minneapolis, where she faithfully writes two pages a day, five days a week.&#34;With its short, vibrant chapters and clear, gentle prose, this triumphant and necessary book conjures the enchantments of childhood without shying away from the fraught realities of abandonment, abuse and neglect...Twirling a baton requires flair and confidence, in addition to an understanding that the baton is always balanced just a tiny bit off-center. There is something wonderfully off-balance, too, about �DiCamillo&#x2019;s storytelling. It allows her characters to sparkle and soar. DiCamillo has called this novel, based partly on her own fatherless Florida childhood, "the absolutely true story of my heart." What a beautiful and generous heart it is.<br>&#x2014;The New York Times Book Review<br><br>As in her previous award-winning books, DiCamillo once again shows that life&#x2019;s underlying sadnesses can also be studded with hope and humor, and does it in a way so true that children will understand it in their bones. And that&#x2019;s why she&#x2019;s Kate the Great.<br>&#x2014;Booklist (starred review)<br><br>DiCamillo's third-person narrative is written in simple words, few exceeding three syllables, yet somehow such modest prose carries the weight of deep meditations on life, death, the soul, friendship, and the meaning of life without ever seeming heavy, and there's even a miracle to boot. Readers will approach the tense and dramatic conclusion and realize how much each word matters. Raymie may not find answers to why the world exists or how the world works, but she can hold onto friends and begin to see more clearly the world as it is...Once again, DiCamillo demonstrates the power of simple words in a beautiful and wise tale.<br>&#x2014;Kirkus Reviews (starred review)<br><br>With extraordinary skill, two-time Newbery Medalist DiCamillo traces the girls&#x2019; growing trust in each other while using understated confessionals and subtly expressed yearnings to show how tragedies have affected each of them. The book culminates with a daring cat-rescue mission: fraught with adventure, danger, and a miracle or two, the escapade reveals how love and compassion can overcome even the highest hurdles.<br>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly (starred review)<br><br>The girls don&#x2019;t form an immediate bond, but their initial association of convenience eventually turns into a friendship of understanding and fierce loyalty. After christening the trio the Three Rancheros, Louisiana delivers these prescient words: &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll rescue each other.&#x201d; And in a beautifully layered set of adventures, they do. The limited third-person narration gives Raymie her distinctive voice and spot-on pre-adolescent perspective of a young girl trying to make sense of the world around her. Here DiCamillo returns&#x2014;triumphantly&#x2014;to her <i>Winn-Dixie </i>roots.<br>&#x2014;The Horn Book (starred review)<br><br>In short, precisely crafted chapters, DiCamillo once again demonstrates her ability to create unique characters that touch readers&#x2019; hearts. Raymie, in particular, is observant, thoughtful, and sensitive as she struggles to make sense of the world around her. Her story unfolds in uncomplicated prose, even as the themes explored are complex. Surrounded by the fully realized Louisiana and Beverly, not to mention the adults in her town, Raymie searches for meaning, a search that will resonate with readers. Poignant, insightful, and ultimately uplifting.<br>&#x2014;School Library Journal (starred review)<br><br>From start to finish, Raymie feels her soul alternately shrinking and expanding like an indecisive balloon as she and her new entourage navigate the waters of friendship and heartbreak, love and loss, life and death. Most of the characters in this fine, funny, meticulously crafted novel live life "wishing for things that are gone," but there's certainly no chance that Raymie's lovely and large soul will ever completely shrivel with a "Phhhhtttt."<br>&#x2014;Shelf Awareness (starred review)<br><br>Although this story is fictional, DiCamillo describes it as the true story of her heart...DiCamillo does a wonderful job of allowing readers into the depths of Raymie&#x2019;s feelings and even into her soul. By the end of the book, readers feel like Raymie, Beverly, and Louisiana are true and lasting friends of their own. It is truly a heart-filled and heartfelt book.<br>&#x2014;VOYA<br><br>Fans will recognize DiCamillo's unique wry voice as it gives readers vivid images, dizzying ideas, humor, heart-wrenching emotions, and gorgeous, gorgeous language. You all have something to look forward to this April, I promise.<br>&#x2014;Huffington Post<br><br>DiCamillo writes with her usual easygoing delicacy; the portray- als of the girls are swift, telling, and gentle, with elliptical hints at Beverly&#x2019;s and especially Louisiana&#x2019;s homelife challenges (lack of money clearly limits Louisiana&#x2019;s diet)...While DiCamillo fans will certainly enjoy reading this on their own, it&#x2019;s also excellent classroom material, encouraging kids to stretch their decoding&#x2014;and also to realize that even if you don&#x2019;t get the outcome you want, it&#x2019;s still possible to find closure.<br>&#x2014;Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books<br><br>It&#x2019;s an inspired choice, for surely this coming-of-age story is a fairy tale for our times.

And a book like this can help. As Raymie&#x2019;s neighbor told her before dying, &#x201c;If you were in a hole that was deep enough and if it was daylight and you looked up at the sky from the very deep hole, you could see stars even though it was the middle of the day.&#x201d; For children looking up from their own deep holes, the Three Rancheros could be those stars.<br>&#x2014;TIME Magazine<br><br>Kate DiCamillo seems always to write with an understanding heart and a gentle archness of tone...As the summer progresses, the girls find poignant points of commonality and a surprising comradeship in this wistful, tender, funny novel for readers ages 10 and older.<br>&#x2014;The Wall Street Journal<br><br>Raymie Nightingale is filled with humor, poignancy, and life-sized lessons.

This marvelous book presents thirty-five paintigs of downy chicks, nestlings, and fledglings painted from life by Sutton. The exquisite watercolrs, housed in the Field Museum of Natural History, span three decades and depict nineteen species of North American birds. Many of the paintings are reproduced here for the first time.</p><p>Sutton was fond of painting young birds from life and of recording their developmental changes. Marked by delicate bruskwork and subtle color variations, his paintings document characteristic features of the birds&#x2019; species as well as capturing the poses and attributes that make each bird seem so unique. Some paintings show not only juvenal plumage but also head portraits of adult plumage. The nineteen species include familiar garden birds such as cardinals, Great Plains inhabitants such as the grassland sparrows, and upland and wetland birds, including bobwhites, moorhens, and sandpipers.</p><p>In his introduction to the collection, ornithologist Paul Johnsgard discusses Sutton&#x2019;s contributions to bird art and to ornithology. And is essays accompanying the paintings, Johnsgard describes his and Sutton&#x2019;s personal encounters with the birds.</p><p>A tribute to Sutton&#x2019;s genius as both an artist and an ornithologist, Baby Bird Portraits will be welcomed by ornithologists, bird enthusiasts, and Sutton&#x2019;s legion of admirers.</p></p><p><p><strong>Paul A. Johnsgard</strong>, Foundation Professor Emeritus of Biological Sciences at the University of Nebraska, is author of more than thirty books.</p></p><h2>Edward Hopper</h2><p>One of America&#39;s foremost figurative painters, Edward Hopper&#39;s unique vision of twentieth-century life continues to challenge accepted artistic conventions and to stimulate social and psychological debate. This book is a fascinating study of this remarkable artist. A representative selection of magnificent full-color plates is accompanied by an absorbing text, enabling the reader to explore both Hopper&#39;s intriguing life and the richness of his work.</p><p></p><h2>Lords of the North (The Saxon Chronicles Series #3)</h2><p><p>The third installment of Bernard Cornwell&#x2019;s bestselling series chronicling the epic saga of the making of England, &#x201c;like Game of Thrones, but real&#x201d; (<em>The Observer</em>, London)&#x2014;the basis for <em>The Last Kingdom</em>, the hit BBC America television series.</p><p>After achieving victory at King Alfred&#x2019;s side, Uhtred of Bebbanburg is returning to his home in the North, finally free of his allegiance to the King&#x2014;or so he believes. An encounter with a vicious slave trader introduces Uhtred to Guthred, the self-proclaimed King of Northumbria. Curious about Guthred&#x2019;s astounding claim, Uhtred follows him north. But he soon discovers fate has another incredible surprise in store, and begins an unexpected journey that climaxes in the midnight siege of a city thought impregnable&#x2014;a dangerous seige that results in the forging of England.</p><p><em>Lords of the North</em> is Bernard Cornwell&#x2019;s finest work yet&#x2014;a breathtaking adventure, but it also tells the story of the creation of English identity, as the English and Danes begin to become one people, appropriating each other&#x2019;s languages and, thrillingly, fighting side-by-side.</p></p><p><p>BERNARD CORNWELL is the author of the acclaimed <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Saxon Tales series, which includes <em>The Last Kingdom, The Pale Horseman, Lords of the North, Sword Song, The Burning Land, Death of Kings, The Pagan Lord</em>, and, most recently, <em>The Empty Throne </em>and <em>Warriors of the Storm</em>, and which serves as the basis for the hit television series <em>The Last Kingdom</em>. He lives with his wife on Cape Cod and in Charleston, South Carolina. </p>Jamie Glover authentically captures the atmosphere of the era of the Saxon Chronicles with seemingly effortless narration in this historical fiction. Uhtred, a warrior whose faith is in his sword, joins forces with the Saxons of Wessex, fighting under the flag of King Alfred against the Danes even though he himself is Danish. Glover portrays Uhtred's divided loyalties with genuine conflict, which soon turns to disgust at King Alfred's lack of generosity when the battles are over. Glover's tight pacing and full attention to nuance and tone portray Uhtred's sense of betrayal. Sounds of battles and clashing swords set the stage for the sequel in this breathtaking adventure series as Uhtred heads north in search of his sister. G.D.W. � AudioFile 2007, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Art of Italy in the Royal Collection: Renaissance and Baroque</h2><p><p>This landmark publication celebrates one of the most exciting periods in European art. It brings together 93 paintings and 85 drawings from the Royal Collection and accompanies an exhibition of international importance.</p><p>The earliest paintings in the book date from the beginning of the sixteenth century and include Giovanni Bellini&#x2019;s <i>Portrait of a Young Man</i>, Lorenzo Costa&#x2019;s <i>Portrait of a Lady with a Lapdog</i>, and the <i>Portrait of a Man</i>, which has previously been attributed to Raphael. From the end of the seventeenth century is the series of twelve paintings on copper by Luca Giordano, illustrating the story of <i>Cupid and Psyche</i>. In between are works by Andrea del Sarto, Bronzino, Caravaggio, Correggio, Titian, Giulio Romano, Jacopa Bassano, Lorenzo Lotto, Palma Vecchio, Veronese, Parmigianino, Tintoretto, Annibale Carracci, Domenichino, Domenico Fetti, Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi, Guido Reni, and Guercino; ranging in scale from small devotional paintings to large altarpieces, and from religious narratives to mythological subjects and portraiture.</p><p>The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries also saw some of the richest and most dynamic developments in Italian drawing, and this book includes some of the finest drawings by many of the greatest artists of the period &#x2013; from the achievements of the High Renaissance (including works by Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, Andrea del Sarto and Parmigianino), through the later Renaissance in northern Italy (Barocci, Tintoretto, the Carracci), to the Baroque in Rome (Domenichino, Bernini, Maratti), Bologna (Reni, Guercino) and beyond. Several of the drawings are published under new attributions, and all the entries reflect recent developments in this field.</p><p>Scholarly thinking on a number of the paintings is also reassessed, in some cases for the first time since John Shearman&#x2019;s <i>The Early Italian Paintings in the Collection of Her Majesty The Queen</i> (1983) and Michael Levey&#x2019;s <i>The Later Italian Pictures in the Collection of Her Majesty The Queen</i> (2nd edn 1991). Fresh insights are drawn from the latest research, and from recent cleaning and conservation, which has transformed critical opinion on a number of the paintings, in particular <i>The Calling of Saints Peter and Andrew</i>, a painting that is now firmly attributed to Caravaggio himself, rather than a follower. There are also further fascinating works by artists rarely encountered in British collections, such as Polidoro da Caravaggio, Francesco Salviati, Federico Zuccaro, Cristofano Allori and Guido Cagnacci.</p></p><p><b>Lucy Whitaker</b> is Senior Curator of Paintings, Royal Collection Trust, and coauthor of several books, including <i>The Northern Renaissance,</i> also published by Royal Collection Trust.</p><h2>Hand of Ftima</h2><p>Snared between two cultures and two loves, one man is forced to choose...1564, the Kingdom of Granada. After years of Christian oppression, the Moors take arms and daub the white houses of Sierra Nevada with the blood of their victims. Amidst the conflict is young Hernando, the son of an Arab woman and the Christian priest who raped her. He is despised and regularly beaten by his own step-father for his &#39;tainted&#39; heritage. Fuelled with the love of the beautiful Fatima, Hernando hatches a plan to unite the two warring faiths - and the two halves of his identity...</p><p>Ildefonso Falcones&#39; first novel, Cathedral of the Sea became a publishing legend with over a million copies sold in Spain alone. It has since been published in over forty countries, becoming a European bestseller. In his latest blockbuster, The Hand of Fatima, Falcones is marking the four hundredth anniversary of the expulsion of the Moors from 17th Century Spain. Falcones is a practising lawyer in Barcelona where he lives with his wife and four sons.</p><h2>The Great Divergence: America&#39;s Growing Inequality Crisis and What We Can Do about It</h2><p><p>For the past three decades, America has steadily become a nation of haves and have-nots. Our incomes are increasingly drastically unequal: the top 1% of Americans collect almost 20% of the nation's income-more than double their share in 1973. We have less equality of income than Venezuela, Kenya, or Yemen.</p><p>What economics Nobelist Paul Krugman terms "the Great Divergence" has until now been treated as little more than a talking point, a club to be wielded in ideological battles. But it may be the most important change in this country during our lifetimes-a sharp, fundamental shift in the character of American society, and not at all for the better.</p><p>The income gap has been blamed on everything from computers to immigration, but its causes and consequences call for a patient, non-partisan exploration. In <i>The Great Divergence</i>, Timothy Noah delivers this urgently needed inquiry, ignoring political rhetoric and drawing on the best work of contemporary researchers to peer beyond conventional wisdom. Noah explains not only how the Great Divergence has come about, but why it threatens American democracy-and most important, how we can begin to reverse it.</p><p><i>The Great Divergence </i>is poised to be one of the most talked-about books of 2012, a jump-start to the national conversation about what kind of society we aspire to be in the 21st century: a land of equality, or a city on a hill-with a slum at the bottom.</p></p><p>Timothy Noah was recently named "TRB," the lead columnist at The New Republic. He wrote for <i>Slate </i>for a dozen years, and previously served at the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, the <i>New Republic</i>, and the <i>Washington Monthly</i>. He edited two collections of the writings of his late wife, Marjorie Williams, including the New York Times bestseller <i>The Woman at the Washington Zoo.</i> Noah received the 2011 Hillman Prize, the highest award for public service magazine journalism, for the series in <i>Slate </i>that forms the basis of <i>The Great Divergence.</i><p>&#x201c;A very impressive and important book&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>William Julius Wilson, The Nation</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Great Divergence</i> by Timothy Noah is a book about income inequality, and if you're thinking, &#x2018;Do we really need another book about income inequality?' the answer is yes. We need this one.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Joe Nocera, New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;In <i>The Great Divergence</i>, the journalist Timothy Noah gives us as fair and comprehensive a summary as we are likely to get of what economists have learned about our growing inequality....Along the way, he enlivens what might otherwise be a dry recounting of research findings with fast-paced historical vignettes featuring colorful characters like the novelist Horatio Alger, the labor leader Walter Reuther, and the business lobbyist Bryce Harlow.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Benjamin Friedman, New York Times Book Review (front page review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Great Divergence</i> is a welcome antidote.... I particularly recommend Noah's list of solutions.... his book is both much needed and a delight to read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Andrew Hacker, The New York Review of Books</i></p><p>&#x201c;Timothy Noah has written a graceful book on income inequality in America, based on his prize-winning 2011 series for <i>Slate</i>. And <i>The Great Divergence</i> is well-timed: it emerges just as inequality is being transformed, via crisis and stress, from an academic backwater into a leading issue of the age ... In short, this is a valuable book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>James K. Galbraith, Salon.com</i></p><p>&#x201c;Superb ... Noah is our unpretentious Detective Columbo, walking us through theories of the case.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Rich Yeselson, The American Prospect</i></p><p>&#x201c;A timely, cogent and fair-minded book from journalist Timothy Noah about the shrinking of the U.S. middle class.... the sentences are graceful, and the points are clear.... I was glad last week when Noah was available to debate Edward Conard, whose forthcoming book, <i>Unintended Consequences</i>, embraces harsh economic inequity as the just reward for innovators. Conard, a former partner in Bain Capital, resides in the upper 0.01 percent income bracket. Noah's book is a rebuttal, a potent argument that the &#x2018;worst thing we could do to the Great Divergence is get used to it.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Karen R. Long, The Plain Dealer</i></p><p>&#x201c;Noah's...thesis is seductive.... [his] book is a valuable addition to the political landscape. Uncontrolled inequality is undermining many of America's best attributes. As he concludes, &#x2018;The worst thing we could do to the Great Divergence is get used to it.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Sasha Abramsky, The Washington Spectator</i></p><p>&#x201c;Noah successfully explains complex economic trends in common parlance. In this presidential election year, his book provides an excellent introduction to the hot topic of income inequality. Recommended for the 99 percent and anyone else concerned with the future of America's middle class.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Rebekah Wallin, Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Economic equality has slipped to an alarming low in the United States. In <i>The Great Divergence</i> Timothy Noah does an excellent job of telling us how this happened--and why it matters ... [an] essential new ... accessible, erudite book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jordan Michael Smith, The Christian Science Monitor</i></p><p>&#x201c;A reader might assume that he's already read Tim's award-winning series in Slate, and the beautiful slideshow that went with it, and wonder whether he needs to read the book as well. The answer is yes - this is in no way a padded out magazine article. The series was about inequality itself; the book is more of a story--and really, in its way, a dramatic one.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Mark Schmitt, WashingtonMonthly.com's "Ten Miles Square" blog</i></p><p>&#x201c;One of 2012's most important books ... a landmark analysis of the subject.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ed Kilgore, WashingtonMonthly.com's "Political Animal" blog</i></p><p>&#x201c;So you're busy and stressed and have time to read just one book on America's faultline crisis of widening inequality. This is the one. Tim Noah, a pro's pro among the nation's press corps, reveals why America has increasingly become a land of haves and have-nots--and how to reverse that soul-crushing trend--with insight, verve, thoroughness and surprising passion. A must read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ron Suskind, author of Confidence Men: Wall Street, Washington and the Education of a President</i></p><p>&#x201c;This book is profoundly fascinating and important. The growth of income inequality over the past three decades has caused a contentious partisan debate based more on ideology than fact. Timothy Noah provides a clear, dispassionate look at what has (and has not) caused this trend and what we can do about it. Everyone who cares about the future of America's middle class should read it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Walter Isaacson, author of Steve Jobs, Einstein, and Benjamin Franklin and President of the Aspen Institute</i></p><p>&#x201c;This may be the most important book of the year. Timothy Noah explores the most significant long-term trend in our country, and he writes with an ease and clarity that makes reading this book a pleasure. Buy it now and read it. You'll probably end up buying more copies for your friends and colleagues.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Thomas E. Ricks, author of Fiasco and The Gamble</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is the book the 99 percent has been waiting for. Crisply lucid and brilliantly argued, The Great Divergence manages to entertain at the same time that it explains. Best of all, Noah offers some strikingly sensible steps to undo the economic polarization that is tearing America apart.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Barbara Ehrenreich, author of Nickel and Dimed; Bait and Switch; and Bright-Sided</i></p><p>&#x201c;A lucid, original, fascinating, and very useful guide to the biggest threat to America's future as a democracy. Noah has pulled together the whole array of explanations for the increasing Third World-ization of America--and he has sorted them out for us, with a guide to which are most important and what we can do about them. This is the book that should have been given out at the Occupy movements and--well, to everyone.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>James Fallows, author of China Airborne and Breaking the News</i></p><p>&#x201c;Timothy Noah has taken the most consequential domestic issue of this or any election and made us understand it in a completely new way. <i>The Great Divergence</i> is compelling, important and hugely readable. I learned something new in almost every sentence.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jonathan Alter, author of The Promise and The Defining Moment</i></p><p>&#x201c;An instant classic.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ariana Huffington</i></p><p>&#x201c;Essential background reading for the coming elections.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Comprehensive, fair-minded, and lucid ...

Number one would be a garage, one- or two-car garage to completely enclose a car with no windows so that no one could tell if a car was there or not there. Also a basement area--or work area--which is hidden and unable to be detected by ordinary means. &nbsp; Naturally, of course, I would need secret hidden compartments for stash areas for various things, as well as a fun area--secret fun area--which would include a cage so that I could have a [female victim] locked up! &nbsp; Also of prime importance--top priority!--would be an incinerator capable of incinerating at extremely high temperatures--total incineration. This could be connected to the lower part of the fireplace in the living room above. &nbsp; Third on my list of goals would be Caryn*, or another female victim first, then Caryn. How about eventually both? &nbsp; I would also want as goal number four enough money to last for a year without working. &nbsp; --from an audiocassette tape-recorded &nbsp; by Mike DeBardeleben &nbsp; On May 5, 1978, after serving twenty-three months of his 1976 counterfeiting sentence at the Federal Penitentiary at Danbury, Connecticut, DeBardeleben was released to a District of Columbia halfway house. In June the sallow, softly-drawling 38-year-old ex-convict moved back into the shabby two-story house he owned at 1201 South Columbus Street in Arlington, and took a barbering job--a condition of his release--but soon stopped showing up for work. &nbsp; In late July, at Brown's Tyson Corner Dodge in Fairfax, Virginia, he bought a dark blue '77 Thunderbird. This is the car with which the Secret Service believes DeBardeleben abducted student nurse Lucy Alexander*. &nbsp; Labor Day weekend, 1978, the luminous dark-blond Alexander went camping with her boyfriend on the Indian River in southwestern Delaware, not far from the Maryland border. On a partly cloudy Sunday, September 3, with an afternoon high in the 70s, the couple drove a few miles south across the state line to Ocean City, where they partied at a bar called Back of the Rack. Shortly past midnight, after several hours of drinking, Lucy and her boyfriend fell into a quarrel. She stalked out the door, headed north on her own, intent on walking the full distance back to their campsite. &nbsp; By one-thirty she'd trudge approximately five miles and gained Fenwick Island, Delaware, on Route One. That's when a dark, late-model luxury vehicle pulled up beside her. The driver was a dark-haired, clean-shaven white male clad in a blue leisure suit, very thin--"wimpy looking" according to Alexander's later statement--who politely inquired where the teenager was headed, and if she wanted a lift. &nbsp; "The Indian River campground," Alexander replied to his first query. "No," she answered his second. She'd rather walk. &nbsp; The friendly stranger persisted. He was headed directly past the campgrounds, he said, and it would be no trouble to drop her off. Lucy Alexander hesitated, considered the hour and the miles she'd already walked, and then relented. &nbsp; "How old are you?" he asked as she climbed into the passenger-side bucket seat. &nbsp; "Nineteen." &nbsp; He seemed surprised. "You look younger than nineteen," the man repeated several times. "Are you sure you're not younger?" &nbsp; The stranger was careful not to betray his intentions until they reached the campground. There he stopped the car, suddenly brandished an official-looking badge, declared himself an FBI agent and told the frightened girl she was under arrest for hitchhiking. Before Alexander could protest or even consider escape, he'd handcuffed her wrist behind her and was driving again. &nbsp; At first he said he planned to deliver her into the custody of local authorities at Rehobeth Beach, about ten miles to the north. Then he said he'd changed his mind, and would drive her to the Sussex Correctional Institution in Georgetown, about twenty miles west. Only after they'd traveled well into the Delaware countryside did he drop the law enforcement charade. &nbsp; He stopped the car in the field. When Alexander began screaming, he gagged and blindfolded her with adhesive tape. He then pushed Lucy over the seat and down onto the back floorboard, covered her with a blanket, and said, "If you listen to me, I won't hurt you." &nbsp; She tried to believe him. &nbsp; Alexander spent the next two hours, according to her estimate, lying in the back of his car, bound, gagged and blindfolded as they drove on, her abductor occasionally belching from the root beer he consumed from an ice chest. She'd remember little else from the trip except that in the middle, more or less, they slowed and she could hear the tinkling of tollway bells. &nbsp; He finally pulled to a stop in what she sensed was a residential neighborhood. A dog barked in the near distance. The man guided her from his car to some low steps, then across a porch or landing into the house where he shoved her upstairs to the right into what seemed to be an empty room. There was a mattress on the floor, covered with a blue blanket. &nbsp; Drawing next to her, he removed Lucy's adhesive tape gag, but left the blindfold in place, explaining that if she saw him in the light he'd have to kill her. Then, as she listened to him rifle through her purse, he announced he was going downstairs to negotiate a ransom with her parents. &nbsp; She hoped that was true, too. &nbsp; He did leave--probably to move his car away from the house--but moments later was back in room, trailing his aura of root beer and stale cigarette smoke. Deprived of sight, Alexander's only sense was of his fingers as they removed her clothing. He commanded her down to the mattress on her back. She obeyed and lay still, listening as he masturbated before dropping onto her and forcing himself inside. &nbsp; He raped her steadily for an hour without ejaculating, she later told police. "Turn over!" the man at last demanded, and then sodomized her. Alexander later remembered her attacker urgently insisting she call him "Daddy" again and again until he could climax. Afterward, he rolled off her and slept. &nbsp; Her next recollection was of a second vaginal rape, followed by another anal rape, and intermittent periods in which he drank more root beer, smoked cigarettes and ate some cheese while he forced Lucy to fellate him. He alternated fellatio with rape. During the former he frequently warned Alexander that he'd kill her if she didn't keep his penis in her mouth. During the later he verbally as well as sexually abused her. He also had difficulty maintaining an erection. He repeated instructed her to call him "Daddy" as he neared orgasm. &nbsp; "Subject would also talk about his ex-wife," read the later FBI report, "saying such things as how they were hard up for money and all she did was spend money and he couldn't afford to pay the bills. Alexander said he would talk about his ex-wife after he raped her." &nbsp; In all, Lucy Alexander was raped at least four times, vaginally and anally, and forced to fellate her kidnapper four or five times over an eighteen-hour period. When she pleaded with him to stop and let her go, he said he would "when I think the time is right." &nbsp; That was late the following night. &nbsp; She could not recall how she was reclothed, only that he took her back downstairs, gave her a drink of water, and then hurried her out to his car with a blanket over her head. Again, he seemed to drive interminably. At one point, he told her that if anything went wrong and a police officer stopped them he'd shoot the cop first and then kill her. &nbsp; By that time death held far less terror for Lucy Alexander than it had the day before. Yet she did survive. At about 2:30 A.M. on Tuesday, September 5, 1978, he released her in an isolated area known as Hardscrabble, about five miles east of Georgetown, Delaware. As her abductor sped away, Lucy Alexander peeled off her blindfold in time to see his brake lights, but nothing else. The next driver she saw was a Delaware state trooper in his patrol car. &nbsp; Copyright � 1994 by Stephen G. Michaud.

She lives in Spring, Texas.<p><strong>Chapter 1</strong></p> <p>The full sphere of the moon and a sprinkling of stars lit the sky as Eric Silver ran as a wolf through San Isabel National Forest where he served as a law enforcement park ranger when on duty. The forest was located two hours from Silver Town, Colorado, owned and run by the Silver wolf pack since the town's inception.</p> <p>He used to don his wolf coat at night when he was off-duty just to enjoy the woods. He found the forest peaceful and rejuvenating as the cool, dry wind whipped the pinyon branches about. Until he'd found ten areas where pot was growing-the scent left by several unknown wolves in each of the areas was too much of a coincidence for him to conclude humans were growing the weed.</p> <p>Now Eric's nightly wolf excursions had become a dangerous business that could turn deadly in a heartbeat. Pot growers had already murdered a couple of park rangers at other locations. The drug dealers had too much to lose if they got caught at this. But the wolves didn't know a wolf pack was trying to track them down.</p> <p>Then Eric smelled a whiff of the scent of one of the wolves he was certain was involved in growing the illegal cannabis. His heart pounded as the thrill of the hunt raced through his blood. Finally!</p> <p>The male wolf loped through the trees dead ahead, unaware that Eric had caught his scent.</p> <p>Eric and his pack had to catch the bastards running this operation before humans did. This was the first time Eric had been close to one. He couldn't lose the wolf now.</p> <p>Keeping lupus garous secret from humans was paramount.</p> <p>Neither Eric, nor any of his pack members, had ever expected to be chasing down pot-growing wolves. Humans were no problem. He would just get hold of his human boss, who would contact various law enforcement agencies to take the criminals down.</p> <p>But Eric couldn't let anyone other than his pack members know about this-not when the lawbreakers were wolves. As a wolf, he had no way to call for backup at this point. He'd been out here for six weeks searching for the wolves and not once had he come across any of them. The way things were going with this investigation, it stood to reason tonight would be one of the few nights he hadn't bothered to call for backup because he hadn't needed anyone any of the other times. He'd figured he could manage on his own if he did run across one of the wolves.</p> <p>The wolf's scent was the same as he'd found at the site of all ten plots of cannabis, and even the scent the wolf gave off now included the smell of cannabis as if he'd brushed up against the plants on a regular basis. Damn the wolf and his partners.</p> <p>Eric needed to identify who he was. Yet he was in a real quandary.</p> <p>If the wolf were in human form, Eric could have arrested and incarcerated him in the Silver Town jail. Since the town was wolf-run, they could keep him there safely. But the culprit was in his wolf coat and Eric assumed the wolf wouldn't allow himself to be captured. That was the difficulty. Darien, his cousin and the leader of their pack, would be furious that Eric had gone after the wolf without calling for backup this time, but what could he do now? He couldn't let the wolf get away.</p> <p>All his senses on high alert, Eric concentrated on the wolf's scent as he continued to run ahead of him. The wolf was confident, not fearful-which meant he didn't yet suspect that anyone was trailing him. Eric glimpsed a tuft of black fur stuck to some of the underbrush, and it smelled like the wolf he was following.</p> <p>They had reached a goatlike path that led to a secluded patch of marijuana. So far, so good-the wolf still didn't suspect he was being followed. Thankfully, for Eric's well-being, no other wolves seemed to be in the area right now. He knew the only way to take this one in was to injure him in a wolf fight, though he would risk being injured too. And then if Eric wounded him, how would he transport the wolf? He'd have to wing it.</p> <p>He moved in to take the wolf down but saw movement to his right. Another wolf. Damn. More beige than gray, the wolf had been hiding in the brush. Hell, one gray wolf against two big gray males? Darien would kill Eric for getting himself into this bind-if he lived through it. He didn't have a choice now. Kill or be killed.</p> <p>Eric whipped around before the wolf hiding in the bush had a chance to attack. He dove for the wolf's right foreleg, hoping to subdue this one before he had to deal with the other wolf. The wolf wasn't prepared for Eric's quick assault, and with two hard chomps in quick succession, Eric brought him down. The wolf yipped and growled, backing away from Eric on three legs, while favoring his injured one.</p> <p>At that, Eric swung around to face the wolf he'd been following. The wolf had finally seen Eric and had tried to sneak up on him silently, like a wolf on a hunt. Eric was certain he couldn't attack this wolf in the same way and get away with it, so growling ferociously, he feinted going for his foreleg, then swung around and bit into the wolf's hind leg. With a snap, he broke it and the wolf yipped in pain.</p> <p>Neither wolf was totally disabled, which was the problem with just breaking their legs. Eric knew of a wolf-a real wolf-that had lost a leg in a trap. She continued to have pups, and when she lost her mate, she began attacking sheep to provide for her young. Luckily, the sheep owner humanely caught her and took her to a wolf sanctuary where she and her pups were cared for. But she proved that a wolf could survive on three legs. Which meant these wolves were still dangerous.</p> <p>Both of the wolves eyed him, growling low, their heads lowered, their tails tucked between their legs, which made him suspect they were beta wolves. One lifted his chin to howl as if he finally realized he'd better do something or be in even worse trouble. Eric knew he was about to call his pack for help. And then Eric would really be a dead wolf. He leaped and tore into the wolf, biting him in the throat just as he felt the black wolf tackle his back. The wolf at his back couldn't get a good hold of Eric because of his broken leg, thank God.</p> <p>Once Eric had taken out the first wolf, he twisted around to deal with the black wolf. The wolf snapped his jaws at him, lunging forward, yipping in pain. He tried to kill Eric with every ounce of strength he possessed. Eric fought him, biting and growling. Still, the wolf managed a lucky bite to Eric's flank and then lifted his snout to howl.</p> <p>Hell. His heart racing, furious with the damn wolves for doing something illegal and putting all their kind at risk, Eric tore into the wolf. He only wanted to take him in. He didn't want to have to kill him. But when he heard another wolf coming, Eric finished the injured black wolf off and raced back down the mountain. The newcomer would have to deal with his dead pack members. Eric could have fought this wolf, but not a whole pack if even more of them were in the vicinity.</p> <p>Even now, he was at risk of running into them. His heart drumming and his flank burning from the bite, he tried to ignore it and ran full out as if a whole pack of wolves was on his tail. With the enhanced healing abilities of the lupus garou, he would recover sooner than if he were just human, but the process could still take some time, depending on how bad his injury was.</p> <p>Eric reached his truck and shifted, the transformation warming his muscles and bones, though his wound burned even more. The shift was instantaneous and he quickly unlocked his door using the code, grabbed his medical bag, and fumbled around inside it for the antiseptic. After wiping the wound down, he bandaged the injury. It wasn't too deep, thankfully. He was hurrying to pull on his clothes when he heard a wolf yip about a half a mile away, in a different direction than where he'd just been.</p> <p>His need to protect kicked in, yet the new wolf could very well be from the same pack that was growing pot. What were the odds that members of two lupus garou packs besides his were here in the park?</p> <p>He grabbed his medical pack and headed out at a run, calling CJ, his deputy sheriff brother, at the same time. "Killed two of the wolves involved in the drug operation. Left when a third was on its way. Now I'm investigating a wolf injury." He gave coordinates for the drug site.</p> <p>"Wait for me to get there. I'm calling it in to Darien and the sheriff, but I'm on my way."</p> <p>"Can't wait, little brother. I'll be cautious."</p> <p>"All right. I'll let everyone know what's going on."</p> <p>Ending the call, Eric approached the area, careful to stay downwind. When he was close enough to see what the problem was without the wolf seeing him, he witnessed five wolves hovering over an injured she-wolf. She was lying on her side near the base of a cliff where evidence of a recent rock slide littered the area. By the way the other wolves were reassuring the injured wolf, Eric assumed they were lupus garous, which surprised the hell out of him. He'd never seen any in the park before his run-in with the other wolves earlier today. But considering the size of the national park, that was understandable. Their scents assured him that none of these wolves had been near the cannabis plants he'd already located. Although they could still be members of the same pack and involved with the operation in other ways.</p> <p>He slowly walked out of the cover of the trees toward the rocky cliff, hands raised to show he wasn't going to shoot them, wanting them to know he was there to help the injured wolf. "I'm a lupus garou like you." Since he was off-duty and no longer wearing his uniform, he filled them in on the rest. "I'm a law enforcement park ranger. My name is Eric Silver. I can take the she-wolf in my truck to the clinic in Silver Town, two hours south of here. The town is all wolf-run."</p> <p>Two of the wolves snarled and growled at him, but they didn't draw closer. He assumed they were betas, trying to figure out what to do. They couldn't take care of the wolf themselves, not as wolves. And running around in the woods as naked humans carrying an injured wolf was going to require a lot of explaining if they ran into anyone else.</p> <p>The injured wolf was still lying on her side. She tried to sit up and yipped, lying back down.</p> <p>"Just lie still," Eric said, motioning for her to stay put, his voice gentle and reassuring.</p> <p>He needed to get closer so he could examine her, but he was cautious about the wolves who were threatening him. Even beta wolves could tear a person apart, so he needed permission to draw closer. Though they probably wouldn't hurt him, he couldn't risk injury by ignoring the threat.</p> <p>When they wouldn't back down, he tried again to convince them he only wanted to help. "I can carry her to my truck, only a mile from here. Some of you can come with me so you know I'm serious about getting help for her."</p> <p>They continued to snarl at him, protecting her, but Eric wouldn't back off either. He wasn't leaving until someone took care of her.</p> <p>Then one of the men shifted. He was maybe in his forties, with black hair and hard amber eyes. "We don't need your help." Even so, the man was obviously in a quandary.</p> <p>Eric took the wolf's shifting as a good sign. Not of friendship, but the wolf would have remained a wolf if he had felt threatened, especially since he appeared to be in charge. He would have led the wolves to attack Eric then, if he was going to do it.</p> <p>At that point, Eric slowly drew closer to the injured wolf. Then he crouched to examine her, hoping they would finally let him help.</p> <p>When he touched her right hind leg, she yipped. "Okay, girl, I'll be gentle. I just need to check to see if it's broken or something else." He carefully ran his hand over her leg, and she pulled it away from his touch.</p> <p>"Is it broken?" the man asked, sounding worried.</p> <p>"I don't feel any break, but it's obviously tender. It could be a bruised tendon, torn ligament, or even a hairline fracture of the bone."</p> <p>"She can't walk on it. We're parked about five miles out."</p> <p>Eric said again, "I'm parked only a mile from here on one of the official-use-only trails. I can carry her to my-"</p> <p>"No. We don't need your help. We'll take care of it."</p> <p>"But-"</p> <p>"I said we'd take care of her."</p> <p>Eric raised his hands in a sign of truce, but he wasn't leaving until he saw that they could provide her with the care she needed. "How are you going to do it? I'm trained in first aid. I can call others from my pack to help get her out of here, or I'll carry her to your vehicle." As much as Eric hated offering, he'd carry her the five miles to their vehicle if that was the only way they'd go for it.</p> <p>"All right. You can carry her to our campsite then."</p> <p>Eric let out his breath in exasperation. Every mile he moved her would cause the poor wolf more pain.</p> <p>The man in charge had already shifted back into his wolf form. He and the other males were watching for signs of anyone else approaching, while the one female stood by the injured she-wolf, looking concerned. Eric made a makeshift splint, and as soon as he bound the injured she-wolf's leg, she whimpered. He hated that she was in pain and wished he could give her something for it. As gently as he could, he lifted her in his arms. This was going to be the longest hike he'd ever made. He wished the wolf in charge had listened to reason.</p> <p>As a wolf, this would have been no problem, even though he was feeling some pain of his own. But as a human carrying an injured wolf, the trek was all the more difficult. He stumbled over too many exposed roots to count because he couldn't see the path, making the she-wolf whimper or yip in pain. He fought groaning himself a time or two.</p> <p>Eric loved the wide open spaces in the park, the seventy-degree temps during the day, and fifty-degree temps during the night-even though in the summer things became rather hectic with all the visitors. He would never have expected to be dealing with this much wolf trouble in one night though, when he'd never seen any other packs in the area before.</p> <p>When they drew closer to a creek, he heard feminine laughter. Despite how chilly it was, the women were splashing around, which intrigued him, although he was worried they might see him carrying a wolf, surrounded by other wolves. Then one of the wolves in the lead ran off. Eric blended in with the lodgepole pines, oaks, and shadows so the women wouldn't see him unless the wolf forced him to go to the rocky bank.</p> <p>Which he did.</p> <p>When Eric drew near enough, he saw five women in goddess-like semi-sheer dresses. He knew he had to be dreaming. Their silky pastel creations-in blues and pinks and mint green-fluttered about the women in the summer breeze. They were standing in the water up to their calves. Above them, the creek water was mostly gentle with a few small rapids. Down here, the rapids were much more common and significant, creating warmer pockets of water. The women were laughing and talking. A petite brunette with short, curly hair really caught his eye. She was wearing a robin's-egg-blue dress, the water sensuously plastering the bottom half of the gown to her calves and thighs.</p> <p>Another woman with her back to him had long, brown hair an...</p></p><h2>How to Build 35 Great Clocks: Complete with Working Plans, Drawings, and Instructions</h2><p>Plans, drawings, and photographs for each of the 35 pieces covering the four basic types of clocks--plaque, shelf, wall, and tall case clocks, and barometers.</p><p></p><h2>The Shroud Maker (WESLEY PETERSON SERIES)</h2><p><p><b>A grisly find . . .</b></p><p>A year on from the mysterious disappearance of Jenny Bercival, DI Wesley Peterson is called in when the body of a strangled woman is found floating out to sea in a dinghy.The discovery mars the festivities of the Palkin Festival, held each year to celebrate the life of John Palkin, a fourteenth century Mayor of Tradmouth who made his fortune from trade and piracy.

Andrews is E. Maynard Adams Professor of English at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is the author of <b>To Tell a Free Story</b> and editor or coeditor of more than thirty books on African American literature.<p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>Autobiography occupies &#x201c;an astonishingly large proportion of the slender shelf of so-called American classics,&#x201d; according to James M. Cox, one of the genre&#x2019;s most astute critics. Cox suggests that this predominance has something to do with the fact that autobiography emerged as a literary form about the same time the United States came into being as a new nation. In a sense, we might say, autobiography and America were made for each other. The revolutions in the United States and shortly thereafter in France demanded a radically new form of self-expression. Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x2019;s <i>Confessions </i>(written between 1764 and 1770 and published posthumously from 1781 to 1788) epitomized this new form in France, while Benjamin Franklin&#x2019;s <i>Autobiography </i>(which its author left incomplete in 1789, a year before his death) came to represent a similar new departure in the eyes of Americans.</p><p>What made these books unprecedented, however, was not the fact that they had an autobiographical agenda. The literature of selfhood, what we have come to term &#x201c;life writing,&#x201d; had had a long and notable history before Rousseau and Franklin made their contributions to it. In the West, autobiography in the most general sense of the word is usually traced back to St. Augustine, who wrote his <i>Confessions </i>of sin and salvation between A.D. 397 and 401. It is not by accident that Rousseau&#x2019;s autobiography bears the same title as Augustine&#x2019;s. For all his individuality, Rousseau wanted his story to be recognized and valued as part of a distinguished tradition. Though some, he admitted, would see him as breaking with that tradition, Rousseau was convinced that he was actually fulfilling its most fundamental demand for an unsparing examination of self.</p><p>Yet to speak of a tradition of <i>autobiography </i>in the time of Rousseau and Franklin is a little misleading, since the term was not known during either man&#x2019;s life. It was not until 1809 that this amalgam of three Greek words meaning &#x201c;self-life-writing&#x201d; came into currency, having been coined apparently by the British poet Robert Southey in a review of Portuguese literature. Neither Rousseau nor Franklin thought of himself as writing autobiography as we understand it today. Franklin&#x2019;s life story is known as his <i>Autobiography </i>because of the decision of editors who, well after Franklin&#x2019;s death, preferred the more modern term to the more old-fashioned &#x201c;memoir,&#x201d; the word Franklin himself used to refer to his book. Rousseau and Franklin were traditional enough to affiliate themselves with two of the most established genres of life writing in Western literature: the confession&#x2014;an inner-directed, soul-searching mode of self-examination&#x2014;and the memoir&#x2014;an externally focused history and justification of a public life. What was revolutionary about Rousseau&#x2019;s <i>Confessions </i>and Franklin&#x2019;s self-styled &#x201c;Memoirs&#x201d; was not the form in which each author addressed his world, but the ways in which each author reshaped and expanded his chosen form to create models of expression that forecast a new form: American autobiography.</p><p>From Augustine to Rousseau, the purpose of writing a confession was to take stock of oneself, morally and spiritually, so as to consider seriously the state of one&#x2019;s relationship to God. In revealing one&#x2019;s sins one broke down barriers between sinner and God and thus opened the door to divine redemption. Like Augustine, Rousseau was determined to confess as fully as possible his moral transgressions&#x2014; and there were many of them&#x2014;but unlike anyone in Christian confessional literature before him, Rousseau claimed special credit from his readers for baring his soul so completely, so honestly, so shamelessly. Instead of thanking God for leading him to confession, as Augustine did, Rousseau denounced society for forcing him to choose between his natural sense of right and the rules of conventional behavior. While admitting that at times he had violated the laws of God and the social order, Rousseau insisted that he should not be condemned by those more culpable than he, namely, those who had capitulated to society&#x2019;s corrupt standards, against which he had struggled, in his view, so heroically. Anyone who would judge him, therefore, was probably hiding behind a mask of suspect respectability and was too false or too fearful to be as open and honest as Rousseau claimed he had proven himself to be. Through this line of argument Rousseau turned the confession of a socially alienated man into an act of self-justification for his own nonconformist individuality. In the end society, not the self, is weighed in the balance and found wanting in this immensely influential model for American autobiography.</p><p>What Franklin called his &#x201c;Memoirs&#x201d; also provided a precedent for American autobiography by presenting the life of a nobody who became a somebody, a provincial outsider who became a cosmopolitan insider, a poor boy who made good and then tried to advise others on how to do the same. Writing a memoir, an account of his rise to success and public leadership, was for Franklin a way of promulgating a view of the individual that stressed humanity&#x2019;s potential to do good rather than its propensity to succumb to evil. Franklin did not look to divine redemption to set men free to do right, as Augustine did, nor did he hold with Rousseau that the individual&#x2019;s innermost feelings and intuition would serve as his or her most reliable guide to the good. Instead, the pragmatic American placed his trust in common sense enhanced by a reasoned, systematic appraisal of what lay in the best interests of the individual and the social order together.</p><p>Like his Puritan New England ancestors Franklin believed that God&#x2019;s will was for everyone to have a calling, a vocation, through which each person would seek not only to fulfill the self but also to benefit the community. Unlike Rousseau, Franklin wrote his autobiography to show how the needs and desires of self and society could be balanced and reconciled so that true progress for all could be effected. Franklin made his life illustrate how a respect for social norms helped him curb the excesses of unrestrained self-regard. At the same time the autobiography bears witness to Franklin&#x2019;s conviction that individual leadership could provide the dynamism needed by the social order to enable it to improve. Thus Franklin&#x2019;s example, though sometimes linked to such rampant individualists as Jay Gatsby, the gaudy hero of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x2019;s classic novel, has little to do with the glorification of crass, single-minded self-seeking. Franklin&#x2019;s story of how a colonial handyman remade himself into an American everyman is told with such mixed self-satisfaction and ironic self-deprecation that most readers are left wondering just how seriously to take Franklin as the archetypal American apostle of success.</p><p>Franklin&#x2019;s retailing of his public successes along with his homely advice on how to make it in the world are not what is most original in the <i>Autobiography. </i>What is fundamentally new is that nowhere in his story does Franklin imply that the act of remaking oneself, the perpetual reinvention of one&#x2019;s role and image in the social order, is in any way revolutionary or even abnormal&#x2014;certainly not for an American. The real American, the true student of schoolmaster Ben, remakes himself not in spite of, or in opposition to, what America is but <i>because </i>he is an American. America is the land of inventors, and the greatest of Americans is the self-inventor&#x2014;and the self-reinventor.</p><p>The most famous expressions of American autobiography in the nineteenth century&#x2014;such works as the <i>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass </i>(1845), Henry David Thoreau&#x2019;s <i>Walden </i>(1854), Mary Chesnut&#x2019;s blend of Civil War novel and diary, composed in the early 1880s but published a century later as <i>Mary Chesnut&#x2019;s Civil War </i>(1981), and <i>The Education of Henry Adams </i>(1907)&#x2014;grew out of a hybridization of confession and memoir, self-revelation and self-celebration. Before the advent of autobiography in the United States, confession and memoir were seen as contrasting, even diametrically opposed, modes of life writing. The impulse to strip the psyche bare and to ask ultimate questions of the self led in one direction. The desire to represent the self in full dress, socially and historically, and to ask of it an accounting of its contribution to the making of the world steered a life history on quite a different course. Yet in the colonies and later the states of North America, the evolving ideology of democracy demanded that the self be regarded as both unique and typical, both the capital of its own spiritual sphere and the cohort of everyone else in the sociopolitical realm. Thus when Americans wrote autobiography they felt the need to explain and justify the self in accordance with inner <i>and </i>external identifications that were by no means easily reconciled. When the American who attempted autobiography was someone other than the white male, in whose interests the ideology of democracy had been designed, the problems of self-representation only intensified as questions arose about the legitimacy of one&#x2019;s claim to selfhood and the willingness of the social order to claim one as a member.</p><p>These conflicting attitudes toward self and society that emerge in the confession and the memoir inform the classics of American autobiography. Those marginalized by race and sex seem to rely more on internal standards of self-evaluation and to picture themselves as pitted against hostile forces intent on robbing them of their carefully nurtured sense of inner worth. The African-American Frederick Douglass and the American Indian Zitkala-Sa, for instance, cast themselves in a Rousseauesque mold, demonstrating strong affinities with the idea that true individuality is forged in an inevitable struggle with the conformism and oppressiveness of a corrupt society. Douglass predicates the &#x201c;resurrection&#x201d; of his self-respect and his &#x201c;manhood&#x201d; on his hand-to-hand battle with a southern slave-breaker, the symbol of all that was tyrannical in the antebellum American social order. In her autobiographical essay, &#x201c;Why I Am a Pagan&#x201d; (1902), Zitkala-Sa takes a bold stand in publicly resisting the orthodox religion of most white Americans and even her own mother, a converted Sioux. Zitkala-Sa pities the Christianized Indians because they have lost their God, their sense of oneness with Nature, and in a cultural sense, themselves, in the process of accepting the white spiritual norm. What links Douglass and Zitkala-Sa to the confessional tradition is not an apologetic view of self but rather a sense of spiritual obligation to chart the self&#x2019;s quest for fulfillment in accordance with its God-given mission&#x2014;to resist white America&#x2019;s denial of colored America&#x2019;s identity.</p><p>As a seventeenth-century Puritan minister&#x2019;s wife, Mary Rowlandson believed that God had brought about her captivity by Narragansett Indians in order to test her faith and her moral fortitude. In her <i>True History </i>(1682), Rowland-son confesses her own waverings and weakness of will, but her story concludes with an affirmation of God&#x2019;s redemptive power. Her experience in the wilderness teaches her to &#x201c;stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord,&#x201d; a message that she proclaims to her reader as a spokesperson for God. Rowlandson&#x2019;s sufferings at the hands of the &#x201c;heathen&#x201d; give her special authority to tell her story and to call attention to herself <i>as </i>one of the favored of God. Yet the ultimate hero of Rowlandson&#x2019;s story is God, who not only delivers her but enables her to read her individual experience as a verification of the principles that held the Puritan social order together. Rowlandson&#x2019;s focus on her individual spiritual quest under the strain of alienation and captivity by the Other links her with the likes of Douglass and, ironically, Zitkala-Sa. But the dovetailing of that spiritual quest with the myths and ideals of the society Rowlandson longed to rejoin after her captivity anticipates the uses to which Franklin would put his autobiography.</p><p>Mark Twain&#x2019;s <i>Old Times on the Mississippi </i>(1875) shows more obvious affinities with the Franklinesque tradition. The former &#x201c;cub,&#x201d; or apprentice pilot, who reminisces about the antebellum heyday of steamboating, recalls his training in the art and science of riverboat piloting partly to celebrate a lost era in American history and partly to show how Sam Clemens became Mark Twain. To graduate from the provincial backwater of his boyhood and be accepted into the grand fraternity of Mississippi riverboat pilots was, for Mark Twain, a metaphoric expression of the American drive for success. Like young Ben Franklin, the unlikely hero of <i>Old Times </i>must undergo an initiation that prepares him for a world in which the prize goes to the quick-witted and the adaptable, not the stolid follower of conventional wisdom. Divested of the comforting dependencies of the landsman, the newly made riverman gains a new self-confidence, which enables him to supplant the pilot who taught him, and a new realism, which shows him how to navigate the ever-shifting currents of American life for himself. Thus like Franklin&#x2019;s account of his own youthful development, Mark Twain&#x2019;s initiation story becomes a living lesson in pragmatic American values, a guide for a society that renews and defines itself primarily by rejecting its guides.</p><p>Placing the classic American autobiographies, whether by a Douglass, a Mark Twain, or a Zitkala-Sa, under a single rubric, either the confession or the memoir, can be a bit risky, however. What reader of Douglass&#x2019;s <i>Narrative </i>would deny that in some important ways this former slave&#x2019;s autobiography incorporates a pattern of successes reminiscent of Franklin&#x2019;s, particularly in the rise of the once-marginalized African-American to economic independence and public prominence? Certainly Douglass intended to offer his rebellion against slavery as a testimonial, an unconquerable selfhood arrayed against the inhumanity of the southern social order. Yet as the fugitive slave proudly recalls his resistance to exploitation in the South, he lays a claim to acceptance and integration in the socioeconomic order of the North, where presumably every self-respecting individual is recognized and rewarded regardless of skin color. Perhaps Douglass was a Rousseauesque autobiographer to his southern enemies and a Franklinesque one in the eyes of his northern supporters. Yet one might wonder: though Douglass had &#x201c;that aversion to arbitrary power&#x201d; that Franklin claims stuck with him throughout his adult life, would Franklin have counseled the outspoken black man to decry in such extreme ways the failures of his America to live up to the ideals that Franklin helped draft into the language of the Declaration of Independence?</p><p>Similar questions about the dual allegiances of American autobiography arise when thinking about <i>Old Times on the Mississippi. </i>How much does Mark Twain&#x2019;s image of the imperious riverboat pilot have in common with Franklin&#x2019;s idea of the democratic hero dedicated to the betterment of his fellows? It would seem that the pilot&#x2019;s aristocratic disdain for the thinking and expression of ordinary landsmen affiliates him with a tradition of lordly individualism that Fr...</p></p><h2>Hearing Things: Religion, Illusion, and the American Enlightenment</h2><p>&#x201c;Faith cometh by hearing&#x201d;&#x2015;so said Saint Paul, and devoted Christians from Augustine to Luther down to the present have placed particular emphasis on spiritual arts of listening. In quiet retreats for prayer, in the noisy exercises of Protestant revivalism, in the mystical pursuit of the voices of angels, Christians have listened for a divine call. But what happened when the ear tuned to God&#x2019;s voice found itself under the inspection of Enlightenment critics? This book takes us into the ensuing debate about &#x201c;hearing things&#x201d;&#x2015;an intense, entertaining, even spectacular exchange over the auditory immediacy of popular Christian piety.<br>The struggle was one of encyclopedic range, and <b>Leigh Eric Schmidt</b> conducts us through natural histories of the oracles, anatomies of the diseased ear, psychologies of the unsound mind, acoustic technologies (from speaking trumpets to talking machines), philosophical regimens for educating the senses, and rational recreations elaborated from natural magic, notably ventriloquism and speaking statues. <i>Hearing Things</i> enters this labyrinth&#x2015;all the new disciplines and pleasures of the modern ear&#x2015;to explore the fate of Christian listening during the Enlightenment and its aftermath.<br>In Schmidt&#x2019;s analysis the reimagining of hearing was instrumental in constituting religion itself as an object of study and suspicion.

It's a dirty little secret of the crime-fiction genre that many of its writers simply spin their wheels, repeating over and over those old tricks which always have worked for them. They coast on past successes and repeat the formula hoping, if not assuming, that their fans won't notice.<p> Writers like Robinson, however, actually seem to grow in front of our eyes, delivering books of greater complexity each time. His previous two books, <i>Cold Is the Grave</i> and <i>In a Dry Season</i>, were novels of character and novels of crime, equally, and now <i>Aftermath</i> is here to reward his fans and new readers alike.</p><p> Like recent books by fellow English writers Reginald Hill, Val McDermid, and Stephen Booth, <i>Aftermath</i> centers upon a grim case in which attractive young girls have disappeared, victims of a cunning psychotic killer whose identity is well concealed behind a fa�ade of respectability. Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks of the Yorkshire Police is in charge of the case, but he's also got unavoidable personal distractions. His separated wife, Sandra, is pregnant by her lover, Sean, and wanting the divorce he's been dragging his heels over.</p><p> There is nothing cozy about the kind of English mysteries written by Peter Robinson, even if they do take place where picturesque rural villages make up the landscape. He's not afraid of gore or deviance, of violence, or of any of the baser emotions, and it's a raw old world behind the hedgerows and cottage walls. If <i>Aftermath</i> is your first taste of his tough-tender sensibility, it won't be surprising if you soon are hooked on the work of one of today's most accomplished practitioners of detective fiction. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>In the early hours of a sweet May morning, two Yorkshire police officers investigating a ?domestic? stumble upon the very worst of crimes ? the sexual torture and murder of a young teenage girl. Moments later, one of the officers is felled by a machete blow, and his rookie, female partner takes out her disgust and fury on the murderer, battering him to death. This is the intensely dramatic, wrenching beginning to the twelfth in Peter Robinson?s award-winning and internationally bestselling Inspector Banks series. <br> <br>The task of investigating Probationary PC Janet Taylor?s actions falls to DI Annie Cabbot, Banks?s lover. This complication to his love life unsettles Banks, but he keeps his mind on his job, one that becomes immeasurably more difficult when the bodies of other teenage girls are found buried in the torturer?s garden. Who are these girls? Why weren?t they all reported missing? These are difficult questions, yet the central question Banks has to answer is how much did the murderer?s wife know? Was she, too, the victim of a sick and twisted man, as she claims, or was she an accomplice? <br> <br>This compelling story is at its heart a deeply sensitive, astute, and ultimately unforgettable exploration of the nature and long-lasting effects of crime and of victimhood. Its intelligence, honesty, and moments of grace lift <i>Aftermath</i> out of the confines of genre fiction and place it in the first rank of novels on crime.</p><h2>Shake Hands With the Devil : The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda</h2><p>On the tenth anniversary of the date that UN peacekeepers landed in Rwanda, Random House Canada is proud to publish the unforgettable first-hand account of the genocide by the man who led the UN mission. Digging deep into shattering memories, General Dallaire has written a powerful story of betrayal, naivete, racism and international politics. His message is simple and undeniable: &#34;Never again.&#34; When Lt-Gen. Romeo Dallaire received the call to serve as force commander of the UN intervention in Rwanda in 1993, he thought he was heading off on a modest and straightforward peacekeeping mission. Thirteen months later he flew home from Africa, broken, disillusioned and suicidal, having witnessed the slaughter of 800,000 Rwandans in only a hundred days. In &#34;Shake Hands with the Devil&#34;, he takes the reader with him on a return voyage into the hell of Rwanda, vividly recreating the events the international community turned its back on. This book is an unsparing eyewitness account of the failure by humanity to stop the genocide, despite timely warnings. Woven through the story of this disastrous mission is Dallaire&#39;s own journey from confident Cold Warrior, to devastated UN commander, to retired general engaged in a painful struggle to find a measure of peace, reconciliation and hope. This book is General Dallaire&#39;s personal account of his conversion from a man certain of his worth and secure in his assumptions to a man conscious of his own weaknesses and failures and critical of the institutions he&#39;d relied on. It might not sit easily with standard ideas of military leadership, but understanding what happened to General Dallaire and his mission to Rwanda is crucial to understanding the moral minefields our peacekeepers are forced to negotiate when we ask them to step into the world&#39;s dirty wars.</p><p>Romeo Dallaire joined the Canadian Army in 1964. A three star General, he served as Deputy Commander of the Canadian Army and later in the Ministry of Defence. In 1993 he was sent to Rwanda on a UN peace-helping mission; he was soon struggling to prevent one of modern history&#39;s most shocking events and the UN&#39;s famous failed mission: the genocide in Rwanda. General Dallaire was medically released from the armed forces in April 2000 due to posttraumatic stress disorder and is now special adviser to the Canadian government on war-affected children and the prohibition of small arms distribution. In January 2002, he received the inaugural Aegis Award for Genocide Prevention in London. The Rwandan genocide is one of the most shocking examples of political exploitation and ethnic cleansing in living memory. It has been immortalised in the films Hotel Rwanda and Shooting Dogs, and here in the words of a seasoned soldier.<b>Introduction</b> <br> <br>It was an absolutely magnificent day in May 1994. The blue sky was cloudless, and there was a whiff of breeze stirring the trees. It was hard to believe that in the past weeks an unimaginable evil had turned Rwanda&#x2019;s gentle green valleys and mist-capped hills into a stinking nightmare of rotting corpses. A nightmare we all had to negotiate every day. A nightmare that, as commander of the UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda, I could not help but feel deeply responsible for. <br> <br>In relative terms, that day had been a good one. Under the protection of a limited and fragile ceasefire, my troops had successfully escorted about two hundred civilians -- a few of the thousands who had sought refuge with us in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda -- through many government- and militia-manned checkpoints to reach safety behind the Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF) lines. We were seven weeks into the genocide, and the RPF, the disciplined rebel army (composed largely of the sons of Rwandan refugees who had lived over the border in camps in Uganda since being forced out of their homeland at independence), was making a curved sweep toward Kigali from the north, adding civil war to the chaos and butchery in the country. <br> <br>Having delivered our precious cargo of innocent souls, we were headed back to Kigali in a white UN Land Cruiser with my force commander pennant on the front hood and the blue UN flag on a staff attached to the right rear. My Ghanaian sharpshooter, armed with a new Canadian C-7 rifle, rode behind me, and my new Senegalese aide-de-camp, Captain Ndiaye, sat to my right. We were driving a particularly dangerous stretch of road, open to sniper fire. Most of the people in the surrounding villages had been slaughtered, the few survivors escaping with little more than the clothes on their backs. In a few short weeks, it had become a lonely and forlorn place. <br> <br>Suddenly up ahead we saw a child wandering across the road. I stopped the vehicle close to the little boy, worried about scaring him off, but he was quite unfazed. He was about three years old, dressed in a filthy, torn T-shirt, the ragged remnants of underwear, little more than a loincloth, drooping from under his distended belly. He was caked in dirt, his hair white and matted with dust, and he was enveloped in a cloud of flies, which were greedily attacking the open sores that covered him. He stared at us silently, sucking on what I realized was a high-protein biscuit. Where had the boy found food in this wasteland? <br> <br>I got out of the vehicle and walked toward him. Maybe it was the condition I was in, but to me this child had the face of an angel and eyes of pure innocence. I had seen so many children hacked to pieces that this small, whole, bewildered boy was a vision of hope. Surely he could not have survived all on his own? I motioned for my aide-de-camp to honk the horn, hoping to summon up his parents, but the sound echoed over the empty landscape, startling a few birds and little else. The boy remained transfixed. He did not speak or cry, just stood sucking on his biscuit and staring up at us with his huge, solemn eyes. Still hoping that he wasn&#x2019;t all alone, I sent my aide-de-camp and the sharpshooter to look for signs of life. <br> <br>We were in a ravine lush with banana trees and bamboo shoots, which created a dense canopy of foliage. A long straggle of deserted huts stood on either side of the road. As I stood alone with the boy, I felt an anxious knot in my stomach: this would be a perfect place to stage an ambush. My colleagues returned, having found no one. Then a rustling in the undergrowth made us jump. I grabbed the boy and held him firmly to my side as we instinctively took up defensive positions around the vehicle and in the ditch. The bushes parted to reveal a well-armed RPF soldier about fifteen years old. He recognized my uniform and gave me a smart salute and introduced himself. He was part of an advance observation post in the nearby hills. I asked him who the boy was and whether there was anyone left alive in the village who could take care of him. The soldier answered that the boy had no name and no family but that he and his buddies were looking after him. That explained the biscuit but did nothing to allay my concerns over the security and health of the boy. I protested that the child needed proper care and that I could give it to him: we were protecting and supporting orphanages in Kigali where he would be much better off. The soldier quietly insisted that the boy stay where he was, among his own people. <br> <br>I continued to argue, but this child soldier was in no mood to discuss the situation and with haughty finality stated that his unit would care and provide for the child. I could feel my face flush with anger and frustration, but then noticed that the boy himself had slipped away while we had been arguing over him, and God only knew where he had gone. My aide-de-camp spotted him at the entrance to a hut a short distance away, clambering over a log that had fallen across the doorway. I ran after him, closely followed by my aide-de-camp and the RPF child soldier. By the time I had caught up to the boy, he had disappeared inside. The log in the doorway turned out to be the body of a man, obviously dead for some weeks, his flesh rotten with maggots and beginning to fall away from the bones. <br> <br>As I stumbled over the body and into the hut, a swarm of flies invaded my nose and mouth. It was so dark inside that at first I smelled rather than saw the horror that lay before me. The hut was a two-room affair, one room serving as a kitchen and living room and the other as a communal bedroom; two rough windows had been cut into the mud-and-stick wall. Very little light penetrated the gloom, but as my eyes became accustomed to the dark, I saw strewn around the living room in a rough circle the decayed bodies of a man, a woman and two children, stark white bone poking through the desiccated, leather-like covering that had once been skin. The little boy was crouched beside what was left of his mother, still sucking on his biscuit. I made my way over to him as slowly and quietly as I could and, lifting him into my arms, carried him out of the hut. <br> <br>The warmth of his tiny body snuggled against mine filled me with a peace and serenity that elevated me above the chaos. This child was alive yet terribly hungry, beautiful but covered in dirt, bewildered but not fearful. I made up my mind: this boy would be the fourth child in the Dallaire family. I couldn&#x2019;t save Rwanda, but I could save this child. <br> <br>Before I had held this boy, I had agreed with the aid workers and representatives of both the warring armies that I would not permit any exporting of Rwandan orphans to foreign places. When confronted by such requests from humanitarian organizations, I would argue that the money to move a hundred kids by plane to France or Belgium could help build, staff and sustain Rwandan orphanages that could house three thousand children. This one boy eradicated all my arguments. I could see myself arriving at the terminal in Montreal like a latter-day St. Christopher with the boy cradled in my arms, and my wife, Beth, there ready to embrace him. <br> <br>That dream was abruptly destroyed when the young soldier, fast as a wolf, yanked the child from my arms and carried him directly into the bush. Not knowing how many members of his unit might already have their gunsights on us, we reluctantly climbed back into the Land Cruiser. As I slowly drove away, I had much on my mind. <br> <br>By withdrawing, I had undoubtedly done the wise thing: I had avoided risking the lives of my two soldiers in what would have been a fruitless struggle over one small boy. But in that moment, it seemed to me that I had backed away from a fight for what was right, that this failure stood for all our failures in Rwanda. <br> <br>Whatever happened to that beautiful child? Did he make it to an orphanage deep behind the RPF lines? Did he survive the following battles? Is he dead or is he now a child soldier himself, caught in the seemingly endless conflict that plagues his homeland? <br> <br>That moment, when the boy, in the arms of a soldier young enough to be his brother, was swallowed whole by the forest, haunts me. It&#x2019;s a memory that never lets me forget how ineffective and irresponsible we were when we promised the Rwandans that we would establish an atmosphere of security that would allow them to achieve a lasting peace. It has been almost nine years since I left Rwanda, but as I write this, the sounds, smells and colours come flooding back in digital clarity. It&#x2019;s as if someone has sliced into my brain and grafted this horror called Rwanda frame by blood-soaked frame directly on my cortex. I could not forget even if I wanted to. For many of these years, I have yearned to return to Rwanda and disappear into the blue-green hills with my ghosts. A simple pilgrim seeking forgiveness and pardon. But as I slowly begin to piece my life back together, I know the time has come for me to make a more difficult pilgrimage: to travel back through all those terrible memories and retrieve my soul. <br> <br>I did try to write this story soon after I came back from Rwanda in September 1994, hoping to find some respite for myself in sorting out how my own role as Force Commander of UNAMIR interconnected with the international apathy, the complex political manoeuvres, the deep well of hatred and barbarity that resulted in a genocide in which over 800,000 people lost their lives. Instead, I plunged into a disastrous mental health spiral that led me to suicide attempts, a medical release from the Armed Forces, the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, and dozens upon dozens of therapy sessions and extensive medication, which still have a place in my daily life. <br> <br>It took me seven years to finally have the desire, the willpower and the stamina to begin to describe in detail the events of that year in Rwanda. To recount, from my insider&#x2019;s point of view, how a country moved from the promise of a certain peace to intrigue, the fomenting of racial hatred, as...</p><h2>The Afghan Amulet: Travels from the Hindu Kush to Razgrad</h2><p>In 1990, armed with five kilos of luggage, a camera, and a liter of vodka, Sheila Paine set off for the high valleys of the Hindu Kush in northern Pakistan, looking for an interesting amuletic pattern relevant to her work as a textile expert.<br>It remained elusive, always to be found "in the next valley." Undeterred, she followed traces of it on tribal costumes and in fabric amulets into increasingly dangerous and remote territories.<br>Over two years, her quest took her into Makran, an area split by the Pakistan/Iran border and totally closed to outsiders, then into Iran itself, once she was able to escape the watchful eye of a suspicious government official. She was smuggled into Afghanistan and continued her journey through Iraqi and Turkish Kurdistan before reaching the Black Sea and the last link in the chain, the small town of Razgrad in eastern Bulgaria.</p><p>On a quest to discover the origins of an exquisite embroidered robe and amulet she found in London, British textile expert Paine chronicles her journeys from Pakistan to Bulgaria through some of the world's wildest outposts of civilization. Determined to track down the source of a tribal dress that protects women against evil spirits, Paine ventures as a lone, vulnerable woman through remote areas of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Kurdistan, Turkey, and Bulgaria she travels armed only with photos of the embroidery, five kilos of luggage, a bottle of vodka, the Afghan amulet around her neck, and cash sewn into her bra and socks. She wends her way by bus, jeep, and hitchhiker's luck through police checks and villages where camels and Kalashinkovs are everyday sights and women's embroidery and crimson sunsets are the only vibrancy in a barren rockscape. A widow in her 60s, Paine stays in homes with bullet-ridden mud walls and in hotels without water, electricity, bedding, phone, or cutlery where she barricades her door to keep out lecherous nocturnal visitors. Babies cry at the sight of her and men either pelt her with rocks or gallantly protect and then assault her. She sneaks into Iran through a Khomeini-crowned gate and is smuggled into Iraq, where Saddam has a bounty on Westerners' heads. Under the protective guises of widowhood, motherhood, and local costume, she enters women's domestic sanctums to view their handiwork. In lyrical prose she describes lands ravaged by extreme seasons and political turmoil, where men discuss nuclear weapons and dowries, and women, hidden by veils, have 18 children while supporting their families. Ultimately, Paine's textile quest, which is solved with a twist, merely provides a pretext for a fascinating and beautifully written account of an odyssey through extreme physical, cultural, and spiritual wildernesses. Paine displays the courage of a frontierswoman and the prose of a poet, making this indispensable for hearty travelers. (3 linecuts and 5 maps) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>An elaborately embroidered tribal dress and an amulet seen in a London shop set Paine off on a two-year hunt through Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kurdistan, Iran, Kohistan, Makran, Turkey, Indus and Bulgaria to find their origin. This 62-year-old British embroidery expert slips across closed borders, navigates through tribal warfare, sleeps on dirt floors, drinks tea brewed from muddy waters and protects herself against the kidnapping, stoning and rape that lone women risk in some Muslim countries by covering herself in native dress. Everywhere she goes, she is warned of danger; everywhere people identify the source of her stitchings as somewhere over the next mountain. Undeterred, Paine follows each clue until, in Bulgaria, she finds the answer to her search. The impoverished conditions, the superstitions that have endured for thousands of years-epitomized by the embroidered symbols that she is tracking-and the tribal and intranational fighting draw such a horrendous picture that the reader marvels at and admires Paine's derring-do. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>From Falling Bodies to Radio Waves: Classical Physicists and Their Discoveries</h2><p>Meet a diverse group of highly original thinkers and learn about their lives and achievements: Galileo, a founding father of astronomy and physics; Christiaan Huygens, a seventeenth-century pioneer of wave-particle duality; and Isaac Newton, the English mathematician and physicist who laid the groundwork for a scientific revolution and promoted radical investigation as the means to reveal nature's hidden workings.<br>This chronicle of physics and physicists traces the development of scientific thought from these originators to their successors, among them Faraday, Watts, Helmholtz, Maxwell, Boltzmann, and Gibbs. Combining his own engaging style with the physicists' original writings, the author illustrates the evolution of individual physical ideas, as well as their roles in the wider field.<br>A student and colleague of Enrico Fermi, Emilio Segr� (1905&#x2013;89) made numerous important contributions to nuclear physics, including his participation in the Manhattan Project. A Nobel laureate, Segr� is further renowned for his narrative skills as an historian. Hailed by the <i>Journal of the History of Astronomy</i> as "charming and witty," this book is a companion to the author's <i>From X-Rays to Quarks: Modern Physicists and Their Discoveries, </i>also available from Dover Publications.</p><p><p><b>Emilio G. Segr�: The History of Physics <br></b>Emilio Segr� (1905&#x2013;1989) became, in 1928, the first student to earn a doctorate in physics at The University of Rome under Enrico Fermi. A decade later, restrictive fascist laws against Jews in academic positions in Italy turned Segr� into an academic refugee &#x2014; he settled in Berkeley where, in 1955, with colleague Owen Chamberlain, he proved the existence of the antiproton, a negatively charged proton that destroys itself as well as the matter it strikes. In 1959, Segr� and Chamberlain shared the Nobel Prize for Physics for their work on antiproton. </p><p> </p><p>From 1943 to 1946, Segr� worked as a group leader on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. In his 1970 book about Fermi, Segr� recalled a crucial atomic test in the New Mexico desert: "In a fraction of a second, at our distance, one received enough light to produce a sunburn. I was near Fermi at the time of the explosion, but I do not remember what we said, if anything. I believed that for a moment I thought the explosion might set fire to the atmosphere and thus finish the earth, even though I knew that this was not possible." </p><p> </p><p>It always seems an opportunity that should not be missed when a major participant in the world of science takes the time and makes the effort to write about his field for a general audience. At Dover we were very pleased to acquire from Emilio Segr�'s heirs the rights to publish his outstanding two-volume history of physics written for the general reader and historian of science: <i>From Falling Bodies to Radio Waves: Classical Physicists and Their Discoveries</i> and <i>From X-Rays to Quarks: Modern Physicists and Their Discoveries,</i> both reprinted by Dover in 2007.</p></p><h2>Greater Swiss Mountain Dog: A Complete and Reliable Handbook (Rare Breed)</h2><p>Book about Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs.

The study of these features connects with many intellectual domains, engaging history, geography, environmental studies, and, in particular, anthropology and archaeology. These diverse fields together provide not only a better understanding of infrastructure but also of social, political, and economic organization, cultural expressions of patterned movement, and the ways in which trails, paths, and roads reflect a culture's traditional knowledge, worldview, memory, and identity.</p><p>The contributors to <i>Landscapes of Movement</i> document these routes across different times and cultures, from those made by hunter-gatherers in the Great Basin of North America to causeways in the Bolivian Amazon to Bronze Age towns in the Near East, examined through aerial and satellite photography, surface survey, historic records, and archaeological excavation. The essays consider many factors in the development and use of trails, paths, and roads, including labor, technology, terrain characteristics, landscape features, access, and ownership. Diverse scales of movement are also addressed, ranging from paths between home and fields to roads used for long-distance journeying. Overall, the book makes the case for the centrality of paths, trails, and roads as an organizing element of human lives throughout history.</p><p>PMIRC, volume 1</p></p><p>James E.

When there vibrations are raised to the proper tone and pitch, consciousness becomes harmonically balanced and wholeness and well-being are outpictured in a person&#39;s life and affairs. The Ten Principles of the Manifestation Process: 1. The Principle of Intunement; 2. The Principle of Choice; 3. The Principle of Acceptance; 4. The Principle on Have; 5. The Principle of Visualization; 6. The Principle of Love; 7. The Principle of the Spoken Word; 8. The Principle of Surrender; 9. The Principle of Gratitude; 10. The Principle of Action. Men and Women below the master level of consciousness can demonstrate the fulfillment of essentially any true desire - IF they choose to do so and will work with the principles on a daily basis.</p><p></p><h2>Hymns for the Celebration of Life</h2><p>HYMNS for the Celebration of Life Contents: HYMNS, READINGS, NOTES ON HYMNS, TUNES, AND READINGS, ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, INDEXES Blue Hardback Hymnal The Hardback is Embossed On Front &amp; Back Of Book Is A Vague Impression Of The The Universalist Tree THE BEACON PRESS, BOSTON Copyright c1964 by Unitarian Universalist Association Library of Congress catalog number : 63-19046 Printed in the United States of America</p><p></p><h2>Framing the Black Panthers: The Spectacular Rise of a Black Power Icon</h2><p><b>A fascinating look at how the Black Panthers became symbols of black militancy in America.</b><br><br><i>"They've been calling us niggers, thugs, and hoodlums for 400 years, that ain't gon' hurt me, I'm going to check out what these brothers is doing."</i>&#x2014;Bobby Seale in 1967<br><br>The Sixties may be over, but the Black Panthers&#x2014;the ultimate symbol of black power, radical inspiration, and the excesses of the decade&#x2014;live on.

Rhodes argues that once the media and pop culture latched onto the small, militant group, the Panthers became adept at exploiting and manipulating this coverage&#x2014;through pamphlets, buttons, posters, ubiquitous press appearances, and photo ops&#x2014;pioneering a sophisticated version of mass media activism.

Erlendur and his team embark on their investigation and soon unearth tensions simmering beneath the surface of Iceland&#x2019;s outwardly liberal, multicultural society. Meanwhile, the boy&#x2019;s murder forces Erlendur to confront the tragedy in his own past. Soon, facts are emerging from the snow-filled darkness that are more chilling even than the Arctic night.</p><p>Arnaldur Indridason, author of the Reykjav�k Thrillers, was born in 1961. He worked at an Icelandic newspaper, first as a journalist and then for many years as a film reviewer. He won the Glass Key Award for Best Nordic Crime Novel for both <i>Jar City</i> and <i>Silence of the Grave</i>, and in 2005 <i>Silence of the Grave</i> also won the Crime Writers Gold Dagger Award for best crime novel of the year. The film of Jar City (available on DVD) was Iceland&#x2019;s entry for the 2008 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. Indridason lives in Reykjav�k with his family.1<br>They were able to guess his age, but had more trouble determining which part of the world he came from. <br>They thought he was about ten years old. He was wearing a grey anorak, unzipped, with a hood, and military-style camouflage trousers. His school bag was on his back. One of his boots had come off and there was a hole in his sock. One toe poked through. The boy was not wearing gloves or a hat. His black hair was already frozen to the ice. He lay on his stomach with one cheek turned up towards them, and they saw his broken eyes staring along the frozen earth. The puddle of blood underneath him had started to freeze. <br>El�nborg knelt down beside the body. <br>&#x2018;Oh my God,&#x2019; she groaned. &#x2018;What on earth is happening?&#x2019; <br>She held out her hand, as though she wanted to touch the body. The boy looked as if he had lain down to take a rest. She had difficulty controlling herself, did not want to believe what she saw. <br>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t move him,&#x2019; Erlendur said calmly. He was standing by the body with Sigurdur �li. <br>&#x2018;He must have been cold,&#x2019; El�nborg muttered, withdrawing her hand and slowly getting to her feet. <br>It was the middle of January. The winter had been reasonable until the New Year, when the temperature dropped sharply. The ground was now covered in a solid coating of ice and the north wind howled and sang around the blocks of flats. Rippling sheets of snow swept along the ground. They collected into little drifts here and there and fine powder snow swirled away from them. Straight from the Arctic, the wind bit their faces and penetrated their clothes, cutting to the bone. Erlendur thrust his hands deep into the pockets of his winter coat and shuddered. The sky was heavy with cloud and it was dark, although it had only just turned four o&#x2019;clock. <br>&#x2018;Why do they make military trousers like that for children?&#x2019; he asked. <br>The three of them stood hunched over the boy&#x2019;s body. The blue flashing lights of the police cars bounced off the surrounding houses and blocks of flats. A few passers-by had gathered by the cars. The first reporters had arrived. Forensics were photographing the scene, their flashes vying with the blue lights. They sketched the layout of the area where the boy was lying and the immediate surroundings. The forensic investigation was in its initial stages. <br>&#x2018;Those trousers are in fashion,&#x2019; El�nborg said. <br>&#x2018;Do you think there&#x2019;s something wrong with that?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li asked. &#x2018;Kids wearing trousers like those?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x2019; Erlendur said. &#x2018;Yes, I find it odd,&#x2019; he added after a pause. <br>He looked up at the block of flats. People were outside on the balconies watching, in spite of the cold. Others stayed indoors and made do with the view through the window. But most were still at work and their windows were dark. The officers would have to go to all the apartments and talk to the residents. The witness who had found the boy said that he lived there. Perhaps he had been alone and had fallen off the balcony, in which case this could be recorded as a nonsensical accident. Erlendur preferred that theory to the idea of the boy having been murdered. He could not pursue that thought through to the end. <br>He scrutinised the surroundings. The garden behind the flats did not seem well kept. In the middle was a patch of gravel that served as a little playground. There were two swings, one broken so that the seat hung down to ground level and spun around in the wind; a battered slide that had originally been painted red but was now patchy and rusty, and a simple see-saw with two little seats made from bits of wood, one end frozen solid to the ground and the other standing up in the air like the barrel of a gigantic gun. <br>&#x2018;We need to find his boot,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said. <br>They all looked at the sock with the hole in it. <br>&#x2018;This is can&#x2019;t be happening,&#x2019; El�nborg sighed. <br>Detectives were searching for footprints in the garden but darkness was falling and they couldn&#x2019;t see much on the frozen ground. The garden was covered with a coat of slippery ice, occasional clusters of grass poking through it. The district medical officer had confirmed the death and was standing where he thought he would be a sheltered from the gale, trying to light a cigarette. He was uncertain about the time of death. Somewhere in the past hour, he thought. He had explained that the forensic pathologist would calculate the exact time of death by correlating the degrees of frost with the body temperature. On first impression the doctor could not identify a cause of death. Possibly a fall, he said, looking up at the gloomy block. <br>The body had not been disturbed. The pathologist was on his way. If possible he preferred to visit the crime scene and examine the surroundings with the police. Erlendur was concerned at the ever-growing crowd gathering at the corner of the block, who could see the body lit up by the flashing cameras. Cars cruised slowly past, their passengers absorbing the scene. A small floodlight was being erected to enable a closer examination of the site. Erlendur told a policeman to cordon off the area. <br>From the garden, none of the doors appeared to be open out onto a balcony from which the boy might have fallen. The windows were all shut. This was a large block of flats by Icelandic standards, six storeys high with four stairwells. It was in a poor state of repair. The iron railings round the balconies were rusty. The paint was faded and in some places it had flaked off the concrete. Two sitting-room windows with a single large crack in each were visible from where Erlendur stood. No one had bothered to replace them. <br>&#x2018;Do you suppose it&#x2019;s racially motivated?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said, looking down at the boy&#x2019;s body. <br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t think we should jump to conclusions,&#x2019; Erlendur said. <br>&#x2018;Could he have been climbing up the wall?&#x2019; El�nborg asked as she, too, looked up at the apartment block. <br>&#x2018;Kids do the unlikeliest things,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li remarked. <br>&#x2018;We need to establish whether he might have been climbing up between the balconies,&#x2019; Erlendur said. <br>&#x2018;Where do you think he&#x2019;s from?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li wondered. <br>&#x2018;He looks Asian to me,&#x2019; El�nborg said. <br>&#x2018;Could be Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Chinese,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li reeled off. <br>&#x2018;Shouldn&#x2019;t we say he&#x2019;s an Icelander until we find out otherwise?&#x2019; Erlendur said. <br>They stood in silence in the cold, watching the drifting snow pile up around the boy. Erlendur looked at the curious bystanders at the corner where the police cars were parked. Then he took off his coat and draped it over the body. <br>&#x2018;Is it safe doing that?&#x2019; El�nborg asked with a glance in the direction of the forensics team. According to procedure they were not even supposed to stand over the body until forensics had granted permission. <br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x2019; Erlendur said. <br>&#x2018;Not very professional,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said. <br>&#x2018;Has no one reported the boy missing?&#x2019; Erlendur asked, ignoring his remark. &#x2018;No enquiries about a lost boy of this age?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;I checked that on the way here,&#x2019; El�nborg said. &#x2018;The police haven&#x2019;t been notified of any.&#x2019; <br>Erlendur glanced down at his coat. He was cold. <br>&#x2018;Where&#x2019;s the person who found him?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;We&#x2019;ve got him in one of the stairwells,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said. &#x2018;He waited for us. Called from his mobile. Every kid carries a mobile phone these days. He said he&#x2019;d taken a shortcut through the garden on his way home from school and stumbled across the body.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll talk to him,&#x2019; Erlendur said. &#x2018;You check whether they can find the boy&#x2019;s tracks through the garden. If he was bleeding he might have left a trail. Maybe he didn&#x2019;t fall.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Shouldn&#x2019;t forensics handle that?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li mumbled to deaf ears. <br>&#x2018;He doesn&#x2019;t appear to have been attacked here in the garden,&#x2019; El�nborg said. <br>&#x2018;And for God&#x2019;s sake, try to find his boot,&#x2019; Erlendur said as he walked off. <br>&#x2018;The boy who found him . . .&#x2019; Sigurdur �li began. <br>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; Erlendur said, turning round. <br>&#x2018;He&#x2019;s also col . . .&#x2019; Sigurdur �li hesitated. <br>&#x2018;What?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;An immigrant kid,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said. <br>The boy sat on a step in one of the stairwells of the block of flats, a policewoman sat with him. He had his sports kit wrapped up in a yellow plastic bag and eyed Erlendur with suspicion. They had not wanted to make him sit in a police car. That could have led people to conclude that he was implicated in the boy&#x2019;s death, so someone had suggested that he wait in the stairwell instead. <br>The corridor was dirty. An unhygienic odour pervaded the air, mingling with cigarette smoke and cooking smells from the flats. The floor was covered in worn linoleum and the graffiti on the wall seemed illegible to Erlendur. The boy&#x2019;s parents were still at work. They had been notified. He was dark-skinned with straight jet-black hair that was still damp after his shower, and big white teeth. He was dressed in an anorak and jeans, and holding a woollen hat in his hands. <br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s awfully cold,&#x2019; Erlendur said, rubbing his hands. <br>The boy was silent. <br>Erlendur sat down beside him. The boy said that his name was Stef�n and he was thirteen. He lived in the next block of flats up from this one and had done so for as long as he could remember. His mother was from the Philippines, he said. <br>&#x2018;You must have been shocked when you found him,&#x2019; Erlendur said after a lengthy silence. <br>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;And you recognised him? You knew him?&#x2019; <br>Stef�n had told the police the boy&#x2019;s name and address. It was in this block but on another staircase and the police were trying to locate his parents. All Stef�n knew about the boy was that his mother made chocolate and he had one brother. He said he had not known him particularly well, nor his brother. They had only quite recently moved to the area. <br>&#x2018;He was called Elli,&#x2019; the boy said. &#x2018;His name was El�as.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Was he dead when you found him?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Yes, I think so. I shook him but nothing happened.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;And you phoned us?&#x2019; Erlendur said, feeling he ought to try to cheer the lad up. &#x2018;That was a good thing to do. Absolutely the right thing. What did you mean when you said his mother makes chocolate?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;She works in a chocolate factory.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Do you know what could have happened to Elli?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;No.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Do you know any of his friends?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Not really.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;What did you do after you shook him?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Nothing,&#x2019; the boy said. &#x2018;I just called the cops.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;You know the cops&#x2019; number?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Yes. I come home from school on my own and Mum likes to keep an eye on me. She . . .&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;She what?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;She always tells me to phone the police immediately if . . .&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;If what?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;If anything happens.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;What do you think happened to Elli?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Were you born in Iceland?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Elli too, do you know?&#x2019; <br>The boy had been staring down at the linoleum on the stairwell floor all the time, but now he looked Erlendur in the face. <br>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; he answered. <br>The front door swung open and El�nborg was blown indoors. A thin sheet of glass separated the stairwell from the entrance and Erlendur saw that she was carrying his overcoat. With a smile he told the boy he might talk to him again later, then stood up and walked over to El�nborg. <br>&#x2018;You know you must only interrogate children in the presence of a parent or guardian or child welfare officer and all that,&#x2019; she snapped as she handed him his coat. <br>&#x2018;I wasn&#x2019;t interrogating him,&#x2019; Erlendur said. &#x2018;Just asking about things in general.&#x2019; He looked at his overcoat. &#x2018;Has the body been removed?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s on its way to the morgue. He didn&#x2019;t fall. They found a trail.&#x2019; <br>Erlendur grimaced. <br>&#x2018;The boy entered the garden from the west side,&#x2019; El�nborg said. &#x2018;There&#x2019;s a path there. It&#x2019;s supposed to be lit but one of the residents told us there&#x2019;s only one lamp-post and the bulbs are always getting smashed. He got into the garden by climbing over the fence. We found blood on it. He lost his boot there, probably when he was clambering over.&#x2019; <br>El�nborg took a deep breath. <br>&#x2018;Someone stabbed him,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;He probably died from a knife wound to the stomach. There was a pool of blood underneath him that froze more or less directly it formed.&#x2019; <br>El�nborg fell silent. <br>&#x2018;He was probably going home,&#x2019; she said eventually. <br>&#x2018;Can we trace where he was stabbed?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;We&#x2019;re working on it.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Have his parents been contacted?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;His mother&#x2019;s on the way. Her name&#x2019;s Sunee. She&#x2019;s Thai. We haven&#x2019;t told her what&#x2019;s happened yet. That&#x2019;ll be terrible.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;You go and be with her,&#x2019; Erlendur said. &#x2018;What about the father?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know. There are three names on the entryphone. One looked something like Niran.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;I understand he has a brother,&#x2019; Erlendur said. <br>He opened the door for her and they went out into the howling north wind. El�nborg waited for the mother. She would go to the morgue with her. A policeman accompanied Stef�n home; they would take a statement from him there. Erlendur went back into the garden. He put on his overcoat. The grass was dark where the boy had been lying. <br>I am felled to the ground. <br>A snatch of old verse entered Erlendur&#x2019;s mind as he stood, silent and deep in thought, looking down at the patch where the boy had been lying. He took a last glance up the length of the gloomy block of flats, then carefully picked his way over the icy ground towards the playground, where he grasped the cold steel of the slide with one hand. He felt the piercing cold crawl up his arm. <br>I am felled to the ground, <br>frozen and cannot be freed . . . &nbsp;Excerpted from Arctic Chill by Arnaldur Indridason.<br>Copyright � 2005 by Arnaldur Indridason.<br>Published in September 2009 by St. Martin's Publishing Group.<br>All rights reserved.

So begins the story of Emma Bean, made from the "scraps of long-ago dresses" by Molly's grandmother. The two are inseparable, from the child's infancy through Emma accompanying her on the first day of kindergarten, where they find new friends in Sara Louise and her bear Gloria. The text, which gently highlights the events in the pair's relationship, is simple and often rhythmic. The illustrations, from the glowing colors of the Maxfield Parrish-like cover to the intimate picture of Molly in bed whispering in Emma's ear with the shadows of night falling across them, capture readers' attention. The artist plays with light, color, and perspective to enhance the mood of the story. Occasionally there is an awkwardly rendered perspective as in the picture of Molly and her father tossing the bunny, which places viewers on the ceiling looking down, yet most are successful. Each full-page picture, set in a white border surrounded by a thin reddish line, evokes the feeling of an unfolding memoir, like pictures in an album. Kathryn Galbraith's Laura Charlotte (Philomel, 1990) is similar in both tone and in the lushness of the illustrations, although Emma Bean focuses more on the relationship between the child and her toy. A book that will appeal to many children.<br><i>Karen James, Louisville Free Public Library, KY</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.A particularly endearing stuffed toy--a very long-earred rabbit, made by Molly's grandmother before her birth--survives the affection of the normally rambunctious child. Toddler Molly is ``feeding'' the toy (while eating independently from a gloriously messy high-chair tray) when she names Emma Bean with what are almost her first words; she shares strawberries with her, plus the bath that follows; later, she makes her clothes, though she's sometimes rough, or neglects her to play with friends. Still, Emma Bean goes along on Molly's first day of school; and when Grandmother observes that she ``looks all worn out,'' Molly declares, ``I am going to keep her forever.'' Wijngaard's lucid, beautifully designed watercolors are exquisitely detailed; his characterizations--the rabbit is appealingly homely, while Molly has a winsome mop of red curls and a sturdy, active little body--are in perfect harmony with the carefully honed story's tender yet unsentimental tone. A fine readaloud or early young reader. (Picture book. 4-8) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

"No place in Italy has such a wide horizon to stare at, nor such a depth of feeling," wrote Malaparte of the locale in Capri where he erected the Casa. "A site only for strong men and for free spirits.... Here, in this wilderness, I am the first one who will build a house."<br>Karl Lagerfeld visited the site for five days in November 1997 and took a series of Polaroids, which he subsequently transferred to Arches moldmade paper.

Frank Baum, marries all the magic and fantasy of The Wizard of Oz to the classic Christmas tale.Nicholas is a mortal child found in the forest and raised by a band of woodland fairies and elves, where he learns to whittle small trinkets and toys from wood. As he grows older, he makes it his mission in life to make children happy by carving and delivering toys. Such traditions like hanging stockings on the chimney, Claus&#x2019;s flying reindeer, and St. Nick&#x2019;s immortality are explained through Baum&#x2019;s colorful narrative thread.Award winning painter Charles Santore, who has interpreted such classics as Peter Rabbit, The Little Mermaid, and The Wizard of Oz, beautifully re-imagines this Christmas fairytale, which is sure to become a Christmas classic on children&#x2019;s bookshelves.Book Details:Format: HardcoverPublication Date: 9/2</p><p><b>L. Frank Baum</b> was born in 1856, to a wealthy family. He was weak in health as a child and spent most of his time reading in his father's study. Baum created fantasy stories for enjoyment rather than moral learning, including the original American fairytale, <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>.<p><b>Charles Santore</b> is a nationally acclaimed illustrator. He is a recipient of the Society of Illustrators' Award of Excellence, the Hamilton King Award, and the Alumni of the Philadelphia College of Art. His works are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Free Library of Philadelphia, and in many private collections. He lives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>Grade 1-3&#x2013;In this significantly shortened version of Baum's 1902 tale, readers learn that Santa Claus, abandoned as a baby, was adopted and raised by a wood-nymph in the magical forest of Burzee. After he grows up and learns about the human world he came from, he decides to devote his life to helping children, and the rest is history. Baum's original language, florid and wordy, has been pared down into a more readable and modern narrative. The large format, brimming with plenty of lush full- and double-page paintings depicting fairies, sprites, Knooks, and a very comely young Claus, will appeal to many children. The Land of Faerie plotline is a tad odd, but all the elements of Santa Claus's story (the reindeer, the chimney-clambering) are reassuringly present.&#x2013;<i>Eva Mitnick, Los Angeles Public Library</i> END</p><h2>Gone South</h2><p><i>It was hell's season, and the air smelled of burning children....</i><br> <br>With &#x201c;one of the most arresting first sentences in contemporary writing&#x201d; (<i>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>), Robert McCammon unfurls his visionary masterpiece of survival, redemption, and the astonishing transformations love can create.<br><br><i>Gone South</i> chronicles a desperate man&#x2019;s journey through a desperate land, in &#x201c;a gothic picaresque that mixes gritty plot and black comedy...a smoothly constructed and satisfying story&#x201d; (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>).<br> <br>Flooded by memories, poisoned by Agent Orange, Dan Lambert kills a man in a moment of fear and fury&#x2014;and changes his life forever.

Before August of 1969, the year he'd turned twenty, his favorite food had been barbecue crispy at the edges and drenched with sloppy red sauce. After the eleventh day of that month, the smell of it was enough to make him sick to death.</p><p>He was driving east through Shreveport on 70th Street, into the glare of the morning sun. It glanced off the hood of his gray pickup truck and stabbed his eyes, inflaming the slow ache in his skull. He knew this pain, and its vagaries. Sometimes it came upon him like a brute with a hammer, sometimes like a surgeon with a precise scalpel. During the worst times it hit and ran like a Mack truck and all he could do was chew on his rage and lie there until his body came back to him.</p><p>It was a hard thing, dying was.</p><p>In this August of 1991, a summer that had been one of the hottest in Louisiana's long history of hellish seasons, Dan was forty-two years old. He looked ten years older, his rawboned, heavily lined face a testament to his ceaseless combat with pain. It was a fight he knew he couldn't win. If he knew for certain he would live three more years, he wasn't sure if he'd be happy about it. Right now it was day-to-day. Some days were all right, some weren't worth a bucket of warm spit. But it wasn't in his nature to give up, no matter how tough things got. His father, the quitter, had not raised a quitter. In this, at least, Dan could find strength. He drove on along the arrow-straight line of 70th Street, past strip malls and car lots and fast-food joints. He drove on into the merciless sun and the smell of murdered innocents.</p><p>Lining the commercial carnival of 70th Street was a score of barbecue restaurants, and it was from their kitchen chimneys that this odor of burned flesh rose into the scalded sky. It was just after nine, and already the temperature sign in front of the Friendship Bank of Louisiana read eighty-six degrees. The sky was cloudless, but was more white than blue, as if all the color had been bleached from it. The sun was a burnished ball of pewter, a promise of another day of misery across the Gulf states. Yesterday the temperature had hit a hundred and two, and Dan figured that today it was going to be hot enough to fry pigeons on the wing. Afternoon showers passed through every few days, but it was just enough to steam the streets. The Red River flowed its muddy course through Shreveport to the bayou country and the air shimmered over the larger buildings that stood iron-gray against the horizon.</p><p>Dan had to stop for a red light. The pickup's brakes squealed a little, in need of new pads. A job replacing rotten lumber on a patio deck last week had made him enough to pay the month's rent and utilities, and he'd had a few dollars left over for groceries. Still, some things had to slide. He'd missed two payments on the pickup, and he needed to go in and see Mr. Jarrett to work something out. Mr. Jarrett, the loan manager at the First Commercial Bank, understood that Dan had fallen on hard times, and cut him some slack.</p><p>The pain was back behind his eyes. It lived there, like a hermit crab. Dan reached beside himself on the seat, picked up the white bottle of Excedrin, and popped it open. He shook two tablets onto his tongue and chewed them. The light turned green and he drove on, toward Death Valley.</p><p>Dan wore a rust-colored short-sleeve shirt and blue jeans with patches on the knees. Under a faded blue baseball cap, his thinning brown hair was combed back from his forehead and spilled over his shoulders; haircuts were not high on his list of priorities. He had light brown eyes and a close-cropped beard that was almost all gray. On his left wrist was a Timex and on his feet was a sturdy pair of brown, much-scuffed workboots. On his right forearm was the bluish-green ghost of a snake tattoo, a reminder of a burly kid who'd had one too many cheap and potent zombies with his buddies on a night of leave in Saigon. That kid was long gone, and Dan was left with the tattoo. The Snake Handlers, that's what they'd been. Not afraid to stick their hands in the jungle's holes and pull out whatever horror might be coiled up and waiting in there. They had not known, then, that the entire world was a snake hole, and that the snakes just kept getting bigger and meaner. They had not known, in their raucous rush toward the future, that the snakes were lying in wait not only in the holes but in the mowed green grass of the American Dream. They got your legs first, wound around your ankles, and slowed you down. They slithered into your guts and made you sick and afraid, and then you were easy to kill.</p><p>In the years since that Day-Glo memory of a night in Saigon, Dan Lambert had shrunken. At his chest-thumping, Charlie-whomping best he'd stood six-two and carried two hundred and twelve pounds of Parris Island-trained muscle. Back then, he'd felt as if he could swallow bullets and shit iron. He weighed about a hundred and seventy pounds now, and he didn't think he was much over six feet. There was a gauntness in his face that made him think of some of the old Vietnamese people who'd huddled in their hootches with eyes as terrified as those of mongrel dogs expecting a boot. His cheekbones jutted, his chin was as sharp as a can opener under the beard. It was the fact that he rarely ate three meals a day, and of course a lot of his shrinkage was due to the sickness, too.</p><p>Gravity and time were the giant killers, he thought as he drove along the sun-washed highway with the back of his sweat-wet shirt stuck to the seat. Gravity shrank you and time pulled you into the grave, and not even the Snake Handlers could beat such fearsome enemies as those.</p><p>He drove through pale smoke that had drifted from the chimney of Hungry Bob's Barbecue Shack, the cook getting all that meat good and black for the lunch crowd. A tire hit a pothole, and in the truck's bed his box of tools jangled. They were the hammers, nails, levels, and saws of a carpenter.</p><p>At the next intersection he turned right and drove south into an area of warehouses. It was a world of chain-link fences, loading docks, and brick walls. Between the buildings the heat lay trapped and vengeful. Up ahead a half-dozen pickup trucks and a few cars were parked in an empty lot. Dan could see some of the men standing around talking. Another man was sitting in a folding chair reading a newspaper, his CAT hat throwing a slice of shade across his face. Standing near one of the cars was a man who had a sign hanging around his neck, and on that sign was hand-lettered WILL WORK FOR FOOD.</p><p>This was Death Valley.</p><p>Dan pulled his truck into the lot and cut the engine. He unpeeled his damp shirt from the backrest, slipped the bottle of aspirin into his pocket, and got out. "There's Dan the man!" Steve Lynam called from where he stood talking with Darryl Glennon and Curtis Nowell, and Dan raised a hand in greeting.</p><p>"Mornin', Dan," Joe Yates said, laying his newspaper in his lap. "How's it hangin'?"</p><p>"It's still there," Dan answered. "I think."</p><p>"Got iced tea." A plastic jug and a bag of Dixie cups sat on the ground next to Joe's folding chair. "Come on over."</p><p>Dan joined him. He drew iced tea into a cup and eased himself down beside Joe's shadow. "Terry got a ticket," Joe said as he offered Dan some of the newspaper. "Fella came by 'bout ten minutes ago, lookin' for a man to set some Sheetrock. Picked Terry and off they went."</p><p>"That's good." Terry Palmeter had a wife and two kids to feed. "Fella say he might be needin' some more help later on?"</p><p>"Just the one Sheetrock man." Joe squinted up toward the sun. He was a lean, hard-faced man with a nose that had been broken and flattened by a vicious fist somewhere down the line. He'd been coming here to Death Valley for over a year, about as long as Dan had been. On most days Joe was an amiable gent, but on others he sat brooding and dark-spirited and was not to be approached. Like the other men who came to Death Valley, Joe had never revealed much about himself, though Dan had learned the man had been married and divorced the same as he had. Most of the men were from towns other than Shreveport. They were wanderers, following the promise of work, and for them the roads on the map led not so much from city to city as from hot-tarred roofs to mortared walls to the raw frameworks of new houses with pinewood so fresh the timbers wept yellow tears. "God, it's gonna be a cooker today," Joe said, and he lowered his head and returned to his reading and waiting.</p><p>Dan drank the iced tea and felt sweat prickling the back of his neck. He didn't want to stare, but his eyes kept returning to the man who wore the desperate hand-lettered sign. The man had sandy-blond hair, was probably in his late twenties, and wore a checked shirt and stained overalls. His face was still boyish, though it was starting to take on the tautness of true hunger. It reminded Dan of someone he'd known a long time ago. A name came to him: <i>Farrow.</i> He let it go, and the memory drifted away like the acrid barbecue smoke.</p><p>"Looky here, Dan." Joe thumped an article in the paper. "President's economics honcho says the recession's over and everybody ought to be in fine shape by Christmas. Says new construction's already up thirty percent."</p><p>"Do tell," Dan said.</p><p>"Got all sorts of graphs in here to show how happy we oughta be." He showed them to Dan, who glanced at the meaningless bars and arrows and then watched the man with the sign again. "Yeah, things are sure gettin' better all over, ain't they?" Joe nodded, answering his own cynical question. "Yessir. Too bad they forgot to tell the workman."</p><p>"Joe, who's that fella over there?" Dan asked. "The guy with the sign."</p><p>"I don't know." He didn't lift his gaze from the paper. "He was there when I got here. Young fella, looks to be. Hell, every man jack of us would work for food if it came to that, but we don't wear signs advertisin' it, do we?"</p><p>"Maybe we're not hungry enough yet."</p><p>"Maybe not," Joe agreed, and ...</p></p><h2>Aircraft Nose Art: 80 Years of Aviation Artwork</h2><p>Describes and captures, in hundreds of illustrations, the colorful paintings--sharks&#39; mouths, scoreboards, cartoon characters--with which soldiers decorated their aircraft from the First World War to Bush&#39;s War in the Gulf.</p><p></p><h2>Henrietta (18th-Century Novels By Women)</h2><p>A pioneer in the tradition of English women&#39;s fiction, Charlotte Lennox was valued friend to both Samuel Richardson and Samuel Johnson and a major influence on Jane Austen. The heroine of Charlotte Lennox&#39;s Henrietta is a young Englishwoman who resists her aunt&#39;s pressure to convert to Catholicism and is set adrift in London society. But unlike many of her passive, vulnerable contemporaries in fiction, the admirable Henrietta makes her way in the world relying on her own cleverness, conviction, and wit. This groundbreaking work of satire and human folly is republished here in a fully annotated modern edition.</p><p>Charlotte Lennox (1730&#x2013;1804) was an English novelist, poet, and playwright. Ruth Perry, professor of literature at MIT, has written widely on women in eighteenth-century England. Her most recent book is Novel Relations: The Transformation of Kinship in English Literature and Culture, 1748&#x2013;1818. Susan Carlile, associate professor of English at California State University, Long Beach, has published articles in numerous journals and is writing a critical biography of Charlotte Lennox."Scholarly editing engenders a sense of responsibility in the editor towards the work and its author, a desire to present the author's work in a full and helpful manner so that other readers may find her work as satisfying as one has oneself. Ruth Perry and Susan Carlile clearly take that responsibility to heart."&#x2015;Susan Kubica Howard, <i>ECF</i><p>"The latest entry in the series is a welcome addition."&#x2015;Kritikon Litterarum</p></p><h2>A Going Concern</h2><p>Inspector C.D. Sloan investigates the death of Octavia Garamond, who left behind some very unusual requests and whose past contains a long-kept, and potentially dangerous, secret, as well as the reason for her death.</p><p>Intricate, witty and thoroughly delightful, Aird's latest case for Chief Inspector C. D. Sloan and Constable Crosby probes a death with roots in WW II biochemical research. Eccentric, elderly Octavia Garamond has left a will directing that the police be present at her funeral and that her doctor examine her body very closely after her death. These odd requests perplex those involved, notably the deceased's only known survivor, Amelia Kennerly, who is named her great-aunt's sole executor. Further questions are raised when Octavia's home at the Grange, Grand Primer, Calleshire, is thoroughly tossed right after her death; when the local parson expresses some reluctance to preside at the funeral; and when two chemical companies engaged in a takeover battle seem somehow connected to Garamond's demise, which is eventually attributed to a poison worthy of Agatha Christie. As Sloan tracks a money angle, Amelia traces a child born out of wedlock in 1940. In the end, these and related mysteries are handsomely resolved and Aunt Octavia turns out to have been mad only "north-north-west" and fully capable of knowing "a hawk from a handsaw" right unto her end. Peopled with a cast that aptly and frequently quotes Shakespeare, this tale is a literate, surprising treat. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The New Building Your Mate&#39;s Self-Esteem: Updated and Expanded Edition</h2><p>The Raineys speak openly and frankly about this problem and give you ten essential building blocks to strengthen your mate and your marriage</p><p></p><h2>Big Data: A Revolution that will Transform How We Live, Work and Think</h2><p>Since Aristotle, we have fought to understand the causes behind everything. But this ideology is fading. The world of big data can crunch an incomprehensible amount of information - giving us results we can't dispute, so we're no longer compelled to try and understand them. Correlation is starting to replace causality. <br> And with this will come many incredible benefits. We're already enjoying a few: utilising search engine results to identify a flu outbreak; using comparison websites; monitoring social media in order to identify trends and opportunities. Moving away from our reliance on absolute understanding will free us to see and make connections that we never thought existed. But it also has its downsides. In an age of big data, will it be machines, not people, which make the decisions? How do you regulate an algorithm? And when statistics and human freedom will clash, which will win out? <br> In this ground-breaking and fascinating book, two of the world's most-admired data experts reveal the reality of a big data world and outline clear and actionable steps that will equip the reader with the tools needed for this next phase of human evolution.</p><p><p><b>Amazon Exclusive: Q&amp;A with Kenneth Cukier and Viktor Mayer-Schonberger</b></p> <p><strong>Q. What did it take to write <em>Big Data</em>?</strong></p> <p>A. Kenn has written about technology and business from Europe, Asia, and the US for <em>The Economist</em>, and is well-connected to the data community. Viktor had researched the information economy as a professor at Harvard and now at Oxford, and his book <em>Delete</em> had been well received. So we thought we had a good basis to make a contribution in the area. As we wrote the book, we had to dig deep to find unheard stories about big data pioneers and interview them. We wanted <em>Big Data</em> to be about a big idea, but also to be full of examples and success stories -- and be engrossing to read.</p> <p><strong>Q. Are you big data&#x2019;s cheerleaders?</strong></p> <p>A. Absolutely not. We are the messengers of big data, not its evangelists. The big data age is happening, and in the book we take a look at the drivers, and big data&#x2019;s likely trajectory: how it will change how we work and live. We emphasize that the fundamental shift is not in the machines that calculate data, but in the data itself and how we use it.</p> <p><strong>Q. In discovering big data applications, what was your biggest surprise?</strong></p> <p>A. It is tempting to say that it was predicting exploding manholes, tracking inflation in real time, or how big data saves the lives of premature babies. But the biggest surprise for us perhaps was the very diversity of the uses of big data, and how it already is changing people&#x2019;s everyday world. Many people see big data through the lens of the Internet economy, since Google and Facebook have so much data. But that misses the point: big data is everywhere.</p> <p><strong>Q. Is <em>Big Data</em> then primarily a story about economic efficiency?</strong></p> <p>A. Big data improves economic efficiency, but that&#x2019;s only a very small part of the story. We realized when talking to dozens and dozens of big data pioneers that it improves health care, advances better education, and helps predict societal change&#x2014;from urban sprawl to the spread of the flu. Big data is roaring through all sectors of the economy and all areas of life.</p> <p><strong>Q. So big data offers only &#x201c;upside&#x201d;? </strong></p> <p>A. Not at all. We are very concerned about what we call in our book &#x201c;the dark side of big data.&#x201d; However the real challenge is that the problem is not necessarily where we initially tend to think it is, such as surveillance and privacy. After looking into the potential misuses of big data, we became much more troubled by &#x201c;propensity&#x201d; -- that is, big data predictions being used to police and punish. And by the &#x201c;fetishization&#x201d; of data that may occur, whereby organizations may blindly defer to what the data says without understanding its limitations.</p> <p><strong>Q. What can we do about this &#x201c;dark side&#x201d;?</strong></p> <p>A. Knowing about it is the first step. We thought hard to suggest concrete steps that can be taken to minimize and mitigate big data&#x2019;s risk, and came up with a few ways to ensure transparency, guarantee human free will, and strike a better balance on privacy and the use of personal information. These are deeply serious issues. If we do not take action soon, it might be too late.</p><i><b>Financial Times</b></i><b> Business Book of the Year Finalist</b> <br> Illuminating and very timely . . . a fascinating and sometimes alarming survey of big data s growing effect on just about everything: business, government, science and medicine, privacy, and even on the way we think. <i>New York Times</i> <br>It seems like big data is in the news every day, as we read the latest examples of how powerful algorithms are teasing out the hidden connections between seemingly unrelated things. Whether it is used by the NSA to fight terrorism or by online retailers to predict customers buying patterns, big data is a revolution occurring around us, in the process of forever changing economics, science, culture, and the very way we think. But it also poses new threats, from the end of privacy as we know it to the prospect of being penalized for things we haven t even done yet, based on big data s ability to predict our future behavior. What we have already seen is just the tip of the iceberg. <br><i>Big Data</i> is the first major book about this earthshaking subject, with two leading experts explaining what big data is, how it will change our lives, and what we can do to protect ourselves from its hazards. <br> An optimistic and practical look at the Big Data revolution just the thing to get your head around the big changes already underway and the bigger changes to come.

Over one million people have experienced dramatic weight loss, lowered cholesterol levels and improved fitness following the Protein Power diet. Drs Michael and Mary Eades have put together a lifestyle plan which shows you how to use food as a tool for dramatic weight loss, resetting your metabolism, lowering bad cholesterol and protecting yourself from diseases such as high blood pressure and heart disease. With the Protein Power diet you can still eat the foods you love, including steaks and burgers, cheese and eggs -- because this eating plan rethinks the current wisdom on fat intake and takes a different look at the fat-inducing carbohydrates like breads and pastas. With over 100 exciting recipes, strength-building exercises, risk assessment questionnaires and advice on metabolism-booting supplements, Protein Power can improve your vital statistics and your well-being.</p><p>If smoked salmon and cream cheese omelets, saut�ed jumbo shrimp, and double-patty burgers suit your palate, belly up to the <i>Protein Power</i> diet: "Not a high protein diet" but "an adequate protein diet." Doctors Michael R. and Mary Dan Eades make a persuasive case in favor of "the diet we were meant to eat."<p> Similar to Dr. Robert Atkins's <i>New Diet Revolution</i>, the authors cite insulin as the main culprit in weight gain and expound the benefits of a diet extremely low in carbohydrates. Carbohydrates, which are changed into sugar during digestion, stimulate the body to store fat, making weight loss virtually impossible. The most revolutionary idea put forth in <i>Protein Power</i> is that the fat you eat has very little bearing on the fat you gain: in other words, we aren't what we eat after all. Researchers have found that eating larger portions of protein in conjunction with severely reduced portions of carbohydrates causes people to burn the excess fat stored in their bodies.</p><p> <i>Protein Power</i> is packed with helpful charts and formulas, so you can estimate your body-fat percentage and your ideal weight for your particular body composition. There are worksheets to calculate your protein need and carbohydrate and protein equivalency charts, as well as charts that allow you to track your fat and weight loss. But this book is not all grams and percentages: it also shows you what a day of eating on this diet would look like and includes sample menus and 70 pages of recipes. If you've been starving yourself for years and just can't seem to lose weight, this may be the diet for you. <i>--Jhana Bach</i></p>Join the thousands who have experienced dramatic weight loss, lowered cholesterol, and improvement or reversal of the damages of heart disease, adult-onset diabetes, and other major diseases by following this medically proven program.<br><br><b>Protein Power</b> will teach you how to use food as a tool for<br><br> Dramatic and permanent weight loss<br> Resetting your metabolism and boosting your energy levels<br> Lowering your "bad" cholesterol levels while elevating the "good"<br> Protecting yourself from "The Deadly Diseases of Civilization" (including high blood pressure and heart disease)<br><br>And best of all, <b>Protein Power</b> encourages you to<br><br> Eat the foods you love, including meats (even steaks, bacon, and burgers), cheeses, and eggs<br> Rethink the current wisdom on fat intake (science has shown that fat does not make you fat!)<br> Stop shocking your body with breads, pastas, and other fat-inducing carbohydrates<br><br>So prepare yourself for the most dramatic life-enhancing diet program available!</p><h2>Love Signs</h2><p>A guide to love and compatability based on sun signs, &#34;Linda Goodman&#39;s Love Signs&#34; explores in depth all the possible combinations of the 12 sun signs.

Introduction to Algorithms combines the attributes of comprehensiveness and comprehensibility. It will be equally useful as a text, a handbook, and a general reference. Introduction to Algorithms covers both classical material and such modern developments as amortized analysis and parallel algorithms. The mathematical exposition, while rigorous, is carefully detailed so that it will be accessible to all levels of readers. Chapters are organized so that they start with elementary material and progress to more advanced topics. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. Algorithms are presented in a pseudocode that can be easily read by anyone familiar with Fortran, C, or Pascal.

The corps of engineers that went ahead of the 33rd Legion carved a road through the Hesperian forest barely wide enough for ten men to march abreast. The skies were heavy with cloud, and this late in the afternoon there was no singing and little talking in the ranks. In front of Marcellinus stretched a column of men three miles long. Behind him, the Seventh and Eighth Cohorts would extend back at least another two miles, guarding the two hundred supply wagons that groaned in the Legion&#x2019;s wake.<br><br>First Centurion Pollius Scapax awaited Marcellinus on the path, pointing into the trees. Marcellinus slid off his horse and peered into the undergrowth. &#x201c;In there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Two men dead,&#x201d; Scapax said tersely. &#x201c;Half a dozen grieving. Thirty or so standing guard.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tullius?&#x201d; The Tribune of the Sixth.<br><br>Scapax shrugged. &#x201c;Not here yet.&#x201d;<br><br>Marcellinus barely hesitated. His adjutants were far forward with the First Cohort, but if he couldn&#x2019;t trust Pollius Scapax, he couldn&#x2019;t trust anyone. He strode off the path, between the oaks, and into a small gap in the trees hardly wide enough to be honored with the name of a clearing.<br><br>One of the dead legionaries rested against an oak, an Iroqua arrow in his shoulder and a short spear buried deep in his gut. The other had been clubbed to the ground, arms broken and legs splayed, his throat slashed open. Both men had been scalped, their foreheads and hair hacked away roughly, leaving shocking bloody gashes in their place.<br><br>Torn bushes and trampled grass gave evidence of a short, sharp struggle. The soldiers&#x2019; weapons and armor were gone, presumably stolen by their murderers.<br><br>The dead men were both fresh-�faced and callow; neither could have been more than eighteen years old.<br><br>At least it was obvious how they had died. Other legionaries had been found with ferocious wounds ripped into their flesh or&#x2014;�maybe even more terrifying&#x2014;�barely a mark on them at all.<br><br>Six men knelt in grief by the corpses, bare-�headed, presumably the tent mates of the dead. &#x201c;Helmets on, soldiers,&#x201d; said Marcellinus. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not lose anyone else here.&#x201d;<br><br>They gaped up at him, incredulous. One man thrust his helmet back onto his head with bad grace. The rest ignored the command, their faces a mixture of pain and insolence. Marcellinus chose not to notice. The days of unquestioning obedience were far behind them now.<br><br>Three contubernia&#x2014;�twenty-�four men in all&#x2014;�faced outward to secure the clearing, heavy spears at the ready. Their eyes scoured the thickets. The men looked nervous, and with good reason. The dead legionaries&#x2019; wounds were fresh, and the alarm had been sounded recently. Whoever had done this could still be hiding in the brush nearby.<br><br>Not twenty feet behind them the behemoth of the 33rd Legion still marched grimly through the eternal forest.<br><br>Marcellinus looked again at the mourning soldiers. He was intruding on their pain, and nothing he could say or do would ease it. &#x201c;Just a few moments longer,&#x201d; he said to Scapax. &#x201c;Then everyone goes back to the column.&#x201d; The men on guard looked relieved.<br><br>Scapax cleared his throat. &#x201c;Burial detail, sir?&#x201d;<br><br>Marcellinus looked again into the underbrush that surrounded them. Pale light filtered through the trees. The last thing he wanted was to have his men exposed any longer than they had to be. But the Seventh Cohort, with the baggage train, must be only minutes away.<br><br>&#x201c;Their choice,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They can wait by the column, put the bodies onto one of the wagons, and bury them tonight, or say their good-�byes now and be done.&#x201d;<br><br>The centurion saluted. As Marcellinus turned to leave the glade, the trumpets sounded again, one far to the west followed by another just a few hundred feet away, a complicated sequence of notes.<br><br>It was a message from Corbulo, his First Tribune. Marcellinus was needed at the head of his Legion. Another obstacle, and clearly something their engineers could not tackle easily.<br><br>Marcellinus&#x2019;s shoulders and back ached from riding. Worse was the low throb of tiredness behind his eyes. Pulling himself wearily back into the saddle, he drummed his heels against his horse&#x2019;s flanks.<br><br>As he rode forward, the Legion was already slowing to a halt.<br><br>Pollius Scapax&#x2019;s voice boomed out across the sloping hillside. &#x201c;First Cohort, stand to! Eyes up, spears out!&#x201d;<br><br>The men of the First fell into battle formation, three ranks in close order. Tired soldiers set the hafts of their heavy pila in the ground and held them angled outward. Archers stood with bows strung and quivers of arrows at their feet, blinking owlishly at the shallow valley. The evening breeze ruffled the crests on their steel helmets.<br><br>No enemy was in sight, but men had died today, and this was hostile territory. The First was mustered to repel any potential attacks while the slaves and the soldiers of the other cohorts made camp.<br><br>The castra was a roving town that re-�created itself daily in its own image. They rebuilt it identically every afternoon, occupied it for one night only, then abandoned it the next morning: civilization on the march through Nova Hesperia.<br><br>The engineers had chosen a site only a couple of miles past the Legion&#x2019;s sudden stop. As usual it was a large open area near a river, on rising ground, with little nearby cover that could be exploited by attackers. Even before the First and Second had arrived, the engineer corps had measured and marked with a knotted rope where the streets would be laid out. Now, the meadow became a hive of activity. Up went the ramparts, earthworks six feet high around the perimeter surrounded by a deep defensive ditch. Down came any trees unfortunate enough to be within the square, their wood pressed into use to construct the raised guard platforms at each corner and above the four gates. Up went the tents, down went the latrines. Finally, up would go the five temples obligatory for feeding the Legion&#x2019;s faiths: the Mithraic temple, the shrines to Cybele and Sol Invictus, the open-�air altar and prayer rail of the Christ-�Risen, and the small but rather forbidding statue of Jupiter Imperator, which had more presence than any of the real-�life Imperators Marcellinus had served.<br><br>The camp was square, with streets constructed on a grid. Its alignment was as constant as its arrangement, with the wide main street called the Cardo aligned north-�south so that the evening and morning light shone down the long cross streets named for the cohorts and centuries that lived on them. The rank and file lived eight men to a tent, and Marcellinus&#x2019;s own Praetorium tent formed the center of the camp. Latrines, the field hospital, stables, the smithy, and the armory were arrayed around the rim with open areas at the corners for the slaves.<br><br>As always, Marcellinus walked the streets as the camp took shape, receiving reports from his tribunes and centurions. The air reeked of stale sweat and fresh wood and rang with shouted orders, banging and sawing, and curses in a broad range of dialects.<br><br>&#x201c;Two more soldiers down,&#x201d; said First Tribune Lucius Domitius Corbulo moodily, joining him at the Eastgate.<br><br>Beside them legionaries and auxiliaries shoveled earth with resolve, digging the deep ditch and throwing the soil up to where their colleagues were shaping the ramparts. The soldiers knew they were being watched by their commanding officers as well as their centurion, and their faces gleamed with sweat. At the crest of the ridge of earth, other men set and bound the sharpened stakes that formed the palisade.<br><br>Marcellinus stepped aside to let a line of a dozen slaves pass, sweating and weighted down by the bags of grain they carried in from the wagons. &#x201c;Two more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Were they good men?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re all good men,&#x201d; said Marcellinus. &#x201c;Legionaries, not auxiliaries, if that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re asking. Young.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do we know what happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Saw a deer and went after it, most likely. Fresh meat is hard to come by.&#x201d;<br><br>Corbulo nodded, acknowledging the convenient lie. &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br><br>Deer rarely approached a marching column. Much more likely that one of them had been caught short by his stomach and had left the column to relieve himself, guarded by his friend, and both had died for it.<br><br>Better for a soldier to die in battle, or hunting, than squatting behind a bush.<br><br>&#x201c;Either way, it has to stop,&#x201d; said Corbulo. &#x201c;Stupid deaths like these?&#x201d;<br><br>Marcellinus glanced sideways. His First Tribune was veering perilously close to insubordination. &#x201c;The centurions have their orders. We can&#x2019;t be more clear. Nobody leaves the column, ever. Nobody lets down their guard for a moment.&#x201d; He shook his head in frustration and set off to walk north along the intervallum inside the still-�growing rampart. After a pause, Corbulo followed in his wake.<br><br>The 33rd Legion had begun to leak men as if from a slow wound soon after they&#x2019;d broken camp and marched away from the Mare Ches�apica. Now, four weeks inland, they were down fifty-�eight soldiers, this out of a legion in which their so-�called centuries had been only seventy men strong to begin with.<br><br>They had cleared villages and taken slaves but had yet to be engaged by the enemy in a real fight. Their losses were due solely to harassing actions: the lone arrow flying out of the trees, the blade from behind, and more often than not, the unexplained disappearance. It was hard enough to march into an empty continent on the wrong side of a giant ocean, blaze a trail, tramp twenty miles along it each day, and then build a marching camp the size of a small town every night without having to risk being picked off by cowardly savages whenever a few twigs&#x2019; worth of cover separated you from your comrades.<br><br>And, since Marcellinus&#x2019;s cohorts were rounded out with the superstitious denizens of Roman provinces from Aethiopia to Scythia, Magyar to Hispania, and back around, the night camp was always alive with rumors. Man-�bears were hiding behind trees; huge hawks were swooping in from the air to pick off the valiant Roman infantry one by one. Giant rodents burrowed up from beneath them. It seemed that in the wilderness of a foot soldier&#x2019;s imagination no animal was allowed to be normally proportioned. Superstition was strong at the best of times in a rabble like that, and the farther away from Urbs Roma he took them, the worse they got.<br><br>Marcellinus shook his head. Nobody in his right mind could feel comfortable with two months of ocean separating him from the Imperium. But however far afield his duties took him, he wasn&#x2019;t about to start believing in giant hawks.<br><br>That left the natives. They were everywhere; on the fleet&#x2019;s arrival the shores of the bay had been crowded with villages of cringing fishermen. Many had fled. Others were now roped to the heavy carts that made up the Legion&#x2019;s supply train.<br><br>Now, though, they&#x2019;d left behind the fisherfolk and the berry pickers. The villages they passed might be empty, but the woods around them were not. Hiding behind the tree trunks of inland Nova Hesperia was a different breed of native altogether.<br><br>Marcellinus turned. &#x201c;Where have you put our prisoner?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Should be in your tent by now.&#x201d; Corbulo cocked an eye at him. &#x201c;I thought you might want her undamaged.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very considerate of you,&#x201d; said Marcellinus, straight-�faced. &#x201c;You have a heart after all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If I do, this country will be the destruction of it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t we supposed to march over all obstacles in our path?&#x201d; If Corbulo could needle him about the deaths, the least Marcellinus could do in return was chide his tribune for letting the whole Legion come to an ignominious halt.<br><br>&#x201c;I was at the rear of the First at the time, consulting with Gnaeus Fabius,&#x201d; said Corbulo, and then, seeing Marcellinus&#x2019;s frown, grudgingly drew himself up a little straighter. &#x201c;Yes, sir . . . It shouldn&#x2019;t have happened. I take responsibility.

The First Cohort? I&#x2019;m surprised they didn&#x2019;t break into a run, straight at her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So am I,&#x201d; said Marcellinus. &#x201c;So am I.&#x201d;<br><br>Corbulo glanced past Marcellinus, grimacing. &#x201c;Ah. Here comes our Britannic ray of sunshine.&#x201d;<br><br>Aelfric, Tribune of the Fourth and Fifth Cohorts, gruff and mustachioed, was walking down a lane toward them. He had shed his armor, but retained the padded jerkin that went between that armor and his tunic, and the scarf that prevented chafing at the neck. Unlike the other legionaries he wore braccae, the woolen breeches of his countrymen. The overall effect was unflattering. Corbulo sniffed.<br><br>Aelfric eyed Corbulo with trepidation but addressed Marcellinus directly. &#x201c;West rampart is up and ready for your inspection, sir. And most of my lot are tents up and set for the evening.&#x201d; He looked leftward at the northern ramparts, where the Second and Third were still toiling, and grinned at Corbulo. &#x201c;Your fellows need a hand, do they?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hardly,&#x201d; said Corbulo, frost in his tone. &#x201c;They just do a proper job.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oooh,&#x201d; said Aelfric. &#x201c;Is that a fact? And what do mine do, then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gentlemen,&#x201d; said Marcellinus.<br><br>Corbulo raised a sardonic eyebrow. Certainly he himself was a patrician, a Roman citizen of the Imperium. The Briton could never be.<br><br>Dropping the matter, Aelfric looked at the skies. The wind was picking up, the tents flapping behind him. &#x201c;Might rain in a bit.&#x201d; To Marcellinus he said, &#x201c;Want me to stop by the Sixth? See if Tully needs anything? He&#x2019;s probably got his hands full, what with the burials and morale and all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he can&#x2019;t wait to see you,&#x201d; said Corbulo. &#x201c;Well, sir, my centurions will be expecting me. Enjoy your interrogation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Interrogation?&#x201d; said Aelfric.<br><br>&#x201c;Up with the news as always,&#x201d; said Corbulo, and with a curt nod to Marcellinus he strode forward to heap invective on a soldier of the Second who had stopped to lollygag with his shovel mate.<br><br>Aelfric watched Corbulo go. &#x201c;He seems out of sorts. What did you do to him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Two more dead,&#x201d; said Marcellinus.<br><br>&#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t forgotten,&#x201d; said the Briton. &#x201c;But they weren&#x2019;t his men.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t matter. Either way, it&#x2019;s my fault.&#x201d; Marcellinus was their Praetor. As Corbulo had just made very clear, it was his job to stop things like this from happening.<br><br>&#x201c;If you say so. But at least it&#x2019;s a slow bloodletting. At this rate we&#x2019;ll have time to walk twice around the world before they get us all.&#x201d;</p><h2>Holy Bible: Precious Moments, New King James Version (NKJV) {271W}</h2><p>Precious Moments Bibles have endured themselves to both the young and the young-at-heart, featuring Sam Butcher&#39;s drawings of loveable children in delicate pastel colors.

Mace and Rebecca Furness, one of the first American women to fly combat aircraft--are drawn into the war</p><p>Former U.S. Air Force captain <b>Dale Brown</b> is the author of several best-selling military-action-aviation-adventure novels: <b>Flight of the Old Dog </b>(1987),<b> Silver Tower </b>(1988),<b> Day of the Cheetah </b>(1989),<b> Hammerheads </b>(1990),<b> Sky Masters </b>(1991),<b> Night of the Hawk </b>(1992),<b> Chains of Command </b>(1993),<b> Storming Heaven </b>(1994) and <b>Shadows of Steel </b>(1996).<b> </b>Dale's novels are published in 11 languages and distributed to over 70 countries.<br><br>Dale was born in Buffalo, New York on November 2, 1956. He graduated from Penn State University and received an Air Force commission in 1978. He was a navigator-bombardier in the B-52G Stratofortress heavy bomber and the FB-111A supersonic medium bomber, and is the recipient of several military decorations and awards including the Air Force Commendation Medal with oak leaf cluster, the Combat Crew Award, and the Marksmanship ribbon. He flew over 2500 hours in various military tactical and training aircraft from 1978 to 1986 and was also a graduate of the U.S. Army Airborne School.<br><br>Dale is a volunteer pilot for AirLifeLine, a non-profit national charitable medical transportation organization who fly needy persons free of charge to receive treatment. He also supports a number of organizations to support and promote law enforcement and reading. He is a member of the Airplane Owners and Pilots Association, The Writers Guild, and a Life Member of the Air Force Association and U.S. Naval Institute. He is a multi-engine and instrument-rated private pilot and can often be found in the skies all across the United States, piloting his Piper Aerostar 602P. On the ground, Dale enjoys tennis, scuba diving, and hockey. He lives in Incline Village, Nevada.Eastern Europe erupts in war as the Russians rush to the aid of their compatriots in Moldova, happily trampling Ukraine in the process. As usual, Air Force veteran Brown (Night of the Hawk, 1992, etc.) gives all the good parts to the pilots. They never get mentioned by name, but America's fast-food swilling, loose-talking, draft-dodging President and his control-freak, borderline-dominatrix, unelected-tsarina, anti-military, knee-jerk liberal wife are the real villains in this near-future military technothriller. Their rush to de-fund the troops--plus their reliance on bull sessions to solve the world's arguments--nearly undoes the nice new world order left by George Bush. They're just not prepared for the brutality of a retro-rigid Russia where old-line Stalinist Vitaly Velichko has usurped Boris Yeltsin's seat and loosed the dogs of war on the former Soviet republics of Moldova and Ukraine. The guy simply does not play fair--he uses nukes without having a meeting to get in touch with the world's feelings. It's up to America's new downsized Air Force to come to the aid of Ukraine, where the planes are all Soviet antiques but the pilots are all heart. American heroes include Robert Redford look-alike Darren Mace, who was supposed to but didn't drop a nuke on Saddam Hussein, and superpilotess- businesswoman Rebecca Furness, a victim of the First Lady's ruthless reductions in force. The Ukrainian hero is Pavlo Tychina, a first-rate flyer out for some serious revenge after his fianc&#x201a;e falls victim to the Russian neutron bomb. The action is, as you expect from Brown, great. But the surprisingly violent Clinton-bashing--while amusing--will probably not make a lot of new friends for the genre. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The attack galvanized Breitweiser politically, and, along with three other 9/11 widows, she fought for the creation of the 9/11 Commission in the face of strong opposition from President Bush and many other top government officials. In this account, she describes her recovery from the nightmare of the attacks, and discusses cover-ups revealed during her campaign for the 9/11 Commission. B&amp;w personal photos are included. There is no subject index. Annotation �2007 Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>KRISTEN BREITWEISER lives in New York City.Kristen Breitweiser's story is as compelling as she is controversial for failing to accept at face value the loss of her husband on 9/11. In WAKE-UP CALL, Breitweiser explains the motivation that compelled her and other 9/11 widows, sometimes called "The Jersey Girls," to become politically active and to criticize the Bush Administration for its alleged failings before and after the attacks. Breitweiser reads with intensity and a sense of purpose that translates superbly to audio. Oddly, at times Breitweister's voice makes her sound too plaintive, distracting from an otherwise strong performance for a narrator clearly new to audiobooks.

Wiggins and Lee are veteran practitioners of the craft of repairing and preserving books, and here they work with Ellis (At Home with Books) to bring these techniques into the home. Their "repair kit" includes a hardbound instruction book, The Booklover's Repair Manual, which deals with the damage books receive in the home, with clear, step-by step, illustrated instructions on how to handle, among other problems, page tears, damaged dust jackets, frayed cover edges and recent minor water damage.

It holds all the non-household tools one needs to undertake the covered repairs, including, among other items, pH-neutral adhesive, cotton library tape, a microspatula and a bamboo brush. With its high sticker price, this item clearly is aimed at serious bibliophiles or those who love them, and just as clearly it will make a splendidDand usefulDgift for anyone who treasures the books in their life.

Having saved their marriage from ending in ruins, the young couple has welcomed a healthy baby girl, Kanon, into their tight-knit family. But with the obvious differences between Hikaru&#39;s and Kanon&#39;s developmental abilities, it becomes apparent that social prejudices against Hikaru&#39;s disability are never far away. As Hikaru moves into fourth grade, Sachiko encounters a new student, Miyu, whose mother has completely given up on her daughter&#39;s life and her own. With the help of Hikaru&#39;s beloved teacher, Aoki-sensei, Sachiko aims to bring hope back to Miyu&#39;s family. But when Aoki-sensei transfers to a different school and Hikaru&#39;s special education class is thrown into upheaval by yet another tragedy, can Sachiko continue to hold on to her own hope for her son&#39;s future?</p><p>Keiko Tobe was an acclaimed Japanese manga artist whose masterwork <i>With the Light</i> strove to bring the everyday struggles of raising a child with autism to a wider audience. <i>With the Light</i> earned her the Japan Media Arts<em></em> Festival's Manga Division Excellence Prize in 2004, and the series was also adapted into a critically-acclaimed drama series in Japan.*Starred Review* The second volume of Tobe&#x2019;s memoir and examination of how autism affects an individual, his family, and his community, as well as how each of those social orders can affect development in the face of an autism diagnosis, collects a dozen issues of the Japanese original. Hikaru Azuma has reached fourth grade, his sister is an independent toddler, and school is a wonderful place with an excellent special-ed teacher. For the first time, Hikaru learns to spend social time with friends, including a younger autistic classmate and peers from a &#x201c;buddy&#x201d; class. Difficulties arise, too. At one point, Hikaru disappears on his own into the city; at another, much more complex in the demands it makes to be sorted out, his ideal teacher and a supportive school principal are replaced by less-motivated, ill-informed persons. Tobe does a stellar job of showing Hikaru and his friends as distinct personalities, visually and behaviorally. She also shares such practical coping strategies as text-messaging to help an autistic child&#x2019;s family participate in social occasions that may otherwise be overly stimulating, and incorporating family reading of the TV guide as a tool to explain ruptures in routine. Newcomers to With the Light can easily start here but will then want to read volume one (2007). --Francisca Goldsmith</p><h2>The Victorians</h2><p>We live in a world the Victorians created. Their two great inventions go hand-in-hand: industrial capitalism and imperialism. A.N. Wilson illuminates these two great facts, not in ideological terms but in personal terms, through the people who built them. In a panoramic survey of the Victorian Age, he describes the men and women who brought the modern age into being.<br><br>The capitalist world came about because of actual businessmen, actual journalists, and actual politicians. It was challenged by the ideas of such men as Karl Marx, William Morris and George Bernard Shaw &#x2014; here they are. Here are the lofty and famous &#x2014; Lord Palmerston, Charles Dickens, Gladstone and Disraeli. And here too are the poor and the obscure &#x2014; doctors ministering to cholera victims in the big cities, young women working as models for the famous painters, the man who got the British hooked on cigarettes, the butchers and victims of conflict in Ireland, India and Africa.<br><br>A.N. Wilson&#x2019;s book is a mosaic in which hundreds of different lives have been pieced together to tell a story &#x2014; a story still unfinished to this day.</p><p>A.N. Wilson holds a prominent position in the world of literature and journalism. He is an award-winning biographer and a celebrated novelist."There will always be an England" ran one of the New Yorker's fabled lines. And there will always be writers-and readers-besotted with the Victorians. Wilson, biographer of John Milton and C.S. Lewis and author of many other works, provides a pastiche of the Victorian age. The 43 chapters are notably brief; the five parts move chronologically through the decades from the 1830s to the 1890s. Individual topics cover the spectrum of life in 19th-century Britain, including high politics and astounding economic progress. Wilson offers vivid sketches of John Ruskin, Robert Browning and many other cultural luminaries. Yet Wilson is, thankfully, not pollyannaish: he depicts the wrenching conditions that industrialization foisted upon the common people and marshals an array of stories that shatter the image of a benign, civilizing colonialism. The many anecdotes about Victorians famous and obscure will delight many readers, but Wilson's book is long on stories and short on explanation. Those with little background in British history will be confused by the parade of people who come and go, and by events that are mentioned but not described. Specialists, on the other hand, will be annoyed by many of the author's judgments, such as the strange comparison of Marx and Hitler and the claim that "there is an inexorability about events and their consequences." Wilson's book has its enjoyable moments, but readers will be better off opening any one of the volumes in Peter Gay's magisterial series, The Bourgeois Experience, Victoria to Freud. 32 pages of illus. not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>How to Train Your Dragon The Hidden World: 1001 Stickers</h2><p><p><b>Based on the billion dollar DreamWorks franchise, join Hiccup and Toothless in this fun-filled sticker activity book - with over 1000 stickers!</b></p><p>A dragon-filled activity book perfect for fans of <i>How To Train Your Dragon</i>!

Taking the name John Paul II, the new Pope delivered a message in his first homily in St. Peter's Square that has resounded throughout his entire papacy: "Be not afraid!" <br><br>Created for the occasion of his twenty-fifth anniversary as Pope, <i>John Paul II: A Light for the World</i> provides a celebration in photographs and words of the courageous pastor who guides more than one billion Catholics and has made his mark on history the world over. Elegantly designed and produced, <i>John Paul II: A Light for the World</i> features over 140 photographs&#x2015;many of which seldom have been seen outside the Vatican&#x2015;by official Vatican photographers who have captured the Pope's remarkable life and ministry for two and a half decades. These beautiful photographs are accompanied by selections from the Pope's own speeches and writings as well as essays and personal reflections by scholars and friends that provide insight into the public and private person of Pope John Paul II. <br><br>Organized into three sections&#x2015;Pastor, Pilgrim, Prophet&#x2015;more than forty essays by staff of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops explore the depth and breadth of the themes central to John Paul's papacy, while nearly thirty personal reflections by cardinals, bishops, and others who have had personal encounters with the Pope reveal his profoundly human, and often humorous, side.<br><br>A joint effort between the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Catholic Communications Campaign and Sheed &amp; Ward, <i>John Paul II: A Light for the World</i> is the definitive commemoration of John Paul II's twenty-fifth anniversary as Pope. The book opens with a personal greeting from Angelo Cardinal Sodano, Vatican Secretary of State; a foreword by Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations; an introduction by Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, president of the USCCB; and a historical sketch by John Thavis, Rom</p><p>Sister Mary Ann Walsh, RSM, was a Sister of Mercy and editor of two books, including Benedict XVI: Essays and Reflections on His Papacy. A frequent commentator on church affairs, she was director of media relations at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. She died in 2015.As the pope's silver jubilee approaches, publishers are gearing up with all manner of tributes to the beloved pontiff. This coffee-table book, with memorable full-color images by official Vatican photographers and reflections by many people who have had personal encounters with John Paul II, may be the pick of the crop. As imprimaturs go, it has an impeccable pedigree: it is an official commemorative book commissioned by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Also, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan weighs in with a foreword highlighting the pope's commitment to international human rights. The book is divided into three sections, exploring the pope's roles as pastor (including his leadership in family life issues and his stand against sexual abuse in the priesthood); a pilgrim (highlighting the more than 700,000 miles the pope has traveled in his tenure); and prophet (discussing his ethical stance on issues such as human rights, racism, labor and the death penalty). Throughout, various cardinals, monsignori and archbishops share brief anecdotes about their personal encounters with the man who was born Karol Wojtyla. While some of these are so fawning as to remove any trace of humanity from the man, other remembrances are candid and humorous. The book's photographs, which span the course of his 25-year papacy, show him interacting with people all over the world, and also depict some private moments. The book closes with a brief chronology of John Paul II's life, as well as synopses of his encyclicals and other key writings. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Composite Structures &amp; Construction:: Modern Methods In Wet Lay-up &amp; Prepreg Construction for Aerospace / Automotive / Marine Applications (DIY Home Workshop)</h2><p>This book has a broad range from Beginners to Seasoned Composite Designers &amp; Fabricators.Composite Construction can be an Idea Fabrication method for:�Aircraft�Cars�Motor Cycles�BoatsWork with a construction medium that will do want you want it to with out an up-hill battle to gain every inch.Easily Achieve Complex Structures with minimal Tooling &amp; Facilities.

Yet the pants settle on each girl's hips perfectly, making her look sexy and long-legged and feel confident as a teenager can feel. "These are magical Pants!" they realize, and so they make a pact to share them equally, to mail them back and forth over the summer from wherever they are. Beautiful, distant Lena is going to Greece to be with her grandparents; strong, athletic Bridget is off to soccer camp in Baja, California; hot-tempered Carmen plans to have her divorced father all to herself in South Carolina; and Tibby the rebel will be left at home to slave for minimum wage at Wallman's.<p> Over the summer the Pants come to represent the support of the sisterhood, but they also lead each girl into bruising and ultimately healing confrontations with love and courage, dying and forgiveness. Lena finds her identity in Greece and the courage not to reject love; Bridget gets in over her head with an older camp coach; Carmen finds her father ensconced with a new fianc�e and family; and Tibby unwillingly takes on a filmmaking apprentice who is dying of leukemia. Each girl's story is distinct and engrossing, told in a brightly contemporary style. Like the Pants, the reader bounces back and forth among the four unfolding adventures, and the melange is spiced with letters and witty quotes.

This new title collects all his work from the original 23 issues of the MAD comic book, all written by Harvey Kurtzman, including hilarious takes on Sherlock Holmes, Frankenstein, Wonder Woman, Archie Comics, Popeye, Mickey Mouse, the Shadow, Dragnet and much more. <br>Collects stories from MAD #1-23.</p><p>Born in New York City in 1921, Will Elder was by all reports a compulsive doodler, covering the walls, windows and ceilings of his parents' apartment with drawings by the age of three. After graduating from New York's High School of Music and Art and studying at the Academy of Design, Elder began his professional comics work in 1946. By 1950, he had joined Harvey Kurtzman at E.C., working on such titles as TWO-FISTED TALES, FRONTLINE COMBAT and WEIRD FANTASY. But it wasn't until the debut of MAD that Elder's genius began to show. From the very first issue, his unmistakable style -- which filled panels to overflowing with sight gags and one-liners -- set the standard for MAD's cluttered and frenzied comedy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When Kurtzman left E.C., Elder went with him and continued their partnership through the regrettably brief runs of Trump, Humbug, and Help!. Then, in 1962, Elder and Kurtzman began their longest and most labor-intensive collaboration -- a fully painted strip for Playboy entitled Little Annie Fanny. The first such strip to be printed in full-process color, Little Annie Fanny required months of work for each episode, and eventually occupied Elder (and several other contributing artists) full time for 20 years. Following a brief reunion with Kurtzman for MAD in the mid-1980s, Elder retired from professional cartooning in 1988. In 2003 he was inducted into the Eisner Awards Hall of Fame, the same year that Fantagraphics Books published the career retrospective Will Elder: The Mad Playboy of Art. Elder passed away on May 14th, 2008.</p><h2>The Roundel: 100 Artists Remake a London Icon (Art on the Underground)</h2><p>The London Underground logo (the &#x201c;roundel&#x201d;) is instantly recognizable, even by those who have never visited the city. Simple and effective, ubiquitous and reassuring, it not only expresses the all-embracing nature of the capital&#x2019;s subway system, but also serves as a powerful brand for London itself. Found the length and breadth of the metropolis, it is now one of the best known and most fondly regarded corporate symbols in the world, and has spawned a host of similar designs from Salt Lake City to Shanghai. <i>The Roundel</i> presents the company&#x2019;s famous sign, rethought and refashioned by 100 international artists. At once imaginative and playful, bold and irreverent, these new interpretations reinvent the logo in photography, paint, drawing, print, collage and sculpture. Among the artists included are Jeremy Deller, Sir Peter Blake, Roger Hiorns, Cornelia Parker, Yinka Shonibare, Gavin Turk, Susan Hiller and Richard Wentworth.</p><p></p><h2>Speer: The Final Verdict</h2><p>Albert Speer is a great enigma. An unemployed architect when Hitler came to power in 1933, he was soon designing the Third Reich's most important buildings. In 1942 Hitler appointed him Armaments Minister and he quadrupled production, an astonishing achievement that kept the German Army in the field and prolonged the war. <br> Yet Speer's life was full of contradictions. The only member of the Nazi elite with whom Hitler developed more than a purely functional relationship (he has even been called "Hitler's unrequited love"), Speer was always an outsider in Hitler's inner circle. He saw himself as an artist, above the crass power struggles of the roughnecks around him, but his enormous ambition blinded him to the crimes in which he played a leading role. <br> Brilliantly illustrated, this gripping account of one man's rise and fall helps explain how Germany descended so far into crime and barbarism.<br></p><p><b>Joachim Fest</b> is the author of several widely respected books on Nazi Germany, including <i>The Face of the Third Reich</i>. Following Speer's release from prison in 1966, Fest worked closely with him as the editor of his memoirs, <i>Inside the Third Reich</i> and <i>Spandau: The Secret Diaries</i>. Fest lives near Frankfurt. <br>Chapter One<br><br>Awakening<br><br>Any survey of a life inevitably starts at the end. Only when the actor has left the stage do the lines emerge from the tangle of existence to form a picture. Historians are easily tempted to describe as inevitabilities those strange accidents that are no more than part of every life. This applies particularly to figures who rose to the top in the Hitler period. It has been common practice to ferret out particular circumstances in their parental homes that appear to explain their career. A lack of attention, for instance, prevented self-esteem from developing, an authoritarian upbringing engendered submissive attitudes, parental severity led to emotional impoverishment, while excessive parental love produced egotists, and so on. The arbitrary rules of this kind of psychology allowed diametrically opposite conclusions to be drawn from identical states of affairs. A child who was beaten would develop into an aggressive type, and so would one who was never beaten. Ultimately any misdeeds were attributed to the damage done in the parental home. In truth, however, all such statements merely raise the questions to which they purport to be the answers.<br><br>Albert Speer, born in Mannheim on 19 March 1905, is a perfect illustration of how unpredictable life is. He came from what in his day was a "normal" privileged family, of the haute bourgeoisie. His early years followed the pattern of a regulated and uneventful youth in the provinces. There is hardly anything striking to report about it. His days passed in agreeable lassitude. Nothing upset the pleasant harmony between home and school, with adventure games by the water, sports clubs, and first love. Biographers have dissected many characteristics from the few incidental discoveries made about those years: the unapproachability of Speer's father, the apparent haughtiness of his mother, and the distant relationship between the three brothers were said, more or less, to have led to the second son's lack of emotion and the shyness that was apparent at an early age. But these simple conclusions tell us virtually nothing about how Albert Speer got into Hitler's entourage and then rose to his unique position at the dictator's court.1<br><br>Like his paternal grandfather, Speer's father was an architect who had made a name for himself with administrative buildings, luxury residences, and villas in the Mannheim area. He had acquired some affluence when, in 1900, he married the daughter of a Mainz merchant, who was descended from Wallenstein's field marshal, von Pappenheim, and who although a forester's son had become a successful entrepreneur. With typical circumspection Speer's father had invested his new wealth mainly in houses and building plots well beyond Mannheim's city limits, all the way to Heidelberg.<br><br>Speer grew up in an upper-middle-class world with the constraints typical of his day. His socially ambitious mother never quite got over having had to leave "golden Mainz" only to be marooned in the sooty industrial town of Mannheim. She tried to compensate for this misfortune with an extravagant lifestyle. In the fourteen rooms of her house she commanded a large staff with the cooks all in white, the maids in black dresses trimmed with white, and the male servants in purple livery with a made-up coat of arms. Everything was exaggerated and staged with a somewhat ostentatious penchant for grandiosity. There was also a chauffeur who looked after the family's two cars, a limousine for the winter and an open vehicle for the summer, as well as a French governess, Mademoiselle Blum, who was of Jewish descent. She used to march the three sons down the street in strict formation. In the entrance hall, heavy Dutch furniture was grouped around a sham fireplace with old Delft tiles; the reception rooms, on the other hand, were in the French style with lighter furniture, crystal, and Lyonnais silk furnishings. Even in the affluent town of Mannheim few families could have afforded anything like it, Speer later observed.2<br><br>For all its spaciousness the house seemed strangely crowded, however, and despite the large staff it was somewhat lifeless. It never really appealed to Speer, and he felt almost liberated when the family moved to Heidelberg in the summer of 1918. Among the plots purchased by his father there was one on the hillside behind the castle, originally intended for the family's summer residence. On the edge of a park-like forest of ancient beeches and oaks he built a villa in the heavy fortress style of the day. Far below lay the town, and beyond its silhouette a panorama of the Rhine plain opened.<br><br>When Speer looked back on his youth it was mainly images from his Heidelberg years that he remembered. The state school he attended after private tuition in Mannheim, the friends he made, and games of cowboys and Indians in the nearby wood opened the door to new worlds. Once outside the parental home, he was offered the leading place as a matter of course wherever he went. In the rowing club he was made cox of the four and, shortly afterward, stroke of the eight. Decades later he tried to note down impressions from those years, as they came to him. The first was of his nursemaid teaching him simple songs, then of his mother in grand attire and behind her the dark, dignified outline of his father. Another recollection was of a visit to Heidelberg Castle, with a zeppelin silently gliding above its venerable ruins. In between there were memories of poems, a performance of Weber's Freisch�tz, and his first visit to the theater to see Schiller's Maid of Orleans, of which he only remembered that it had been "a tremendous experience."3 On further reflection he realized that technological and romantic matters had stayed with him more than anything else-aircraft on the one hand, and poetical and musical experiences on the other.<br><br>Relations continued to be difficult with his parents, who were virtually strangers to him. Nor did relations improve with his brothers. They were noisy and robust, while Albert was physically delicate and of unstable health. He admired his father but found him too reserved to confide in him. The inhibitions that all observers later remarked on were already conspicuous in those early years. Speer's mother, who had sought refuge from various disappointments in a restless social life filled with receptions and house parties, remained aloof. All the possessions she accumulated failed to fill the void that surrounded her. By cultivating an ostentatious style she tried to perpetuate the circumstances and standards which had once made the middle class great. But now these trappings seemed like imitations, an empty spectacle on an overloaded stage set, revealing the very vacuum it sought to conceal.<br><br>Unlike his mother, Speer's father had strong principles. He was practical and always correctly dressed, with a gold watch chain, a twirled mustache, and his hair cut short. For all his sobriety, his background and his newfound family pride equipped him with a sure sense of middle-class values. On a visit to Berlin in the mid-thirties, he attended a theater premi�re with his unexpectedly high-powered son, and Hitler invited him to his box in the intermission. No sooner had he been presented than he was overcome by a violent trembling. He turned pale, paralyzed by the torrent of words beating down on him. Speer later suspected that his father had sensed the frightening aura of otherness that Hitler radiated. It was, as the conservative historian Otto Hintze described the dictator, like suddenly finding oneself in the presence of a person with something "utterly alien" about them, "something of an otherwise extinct primordial race, which was completely amoral." Speer's father took his leave as soon as Hitler ended, bowing stiffly without a word of response.4<br><br>Speer's father regarded himself as belonging to that liberal tradition that had always championed the interests and libertarian views of the bourgeoisie. He particularly identified with Friedrich Naumann's social reformist views, although in the twenties he had abandoned Naumann's nationalist ideas for the pan-European ideals of Count Coudenhove-Kalergi. He always realized that no democratic order could survive on its own: the individual had to have and, if necessary, defend intellectual and political independence, and be determined to take responsibility at a professional level. No doubt he felt more upset than Speer's account suggests when, after passing his examinations with flying colors, his son expressed the wish to study his favorite subject, mathematics. With that, his father pointed out, he might possibly become a university professor or a teacher, but he would not attain that independence which would meet his personal expectations and social requirements. In the end he persuaded his son to follow the family tradition and study architecture.<br><br>Despite his independent judgment, however, Speer's father was also afflicted by the prejudices and the defensive attitudes so widespread among the middle class since the turn of the century. In his Mannheim years Albert Speer had already displayed a disturbing preference for the children of caretakers and for impecunious schoolmates outside his own social circle. At first his parents were dismayed when in 1922 he fell in love with the daughter of a joiner, only slightly younger than himself. Then they became increasingly indignant, although their social superiority over the master joiner Weber was far from great. After all, within a few years he had built up a prosperous enterprise employing some fifty workers. As a Heidelberg town councillor, he was one of the town's leading citizens. The Webers' social rise basically matched that of the Speers a generation earlier. But in keeping with the prejudices of the day, the Speers looked down on the Webers and were never able to forget the gulf between them.<br><br>The following year, when the young people announced their decision to get married as soon as possible, not only Speer's parents but, significantly, the Webers also did everything possible to foil this inte...</p><h2>Cassius Marcellus Clay: Firebrand of freedom (The Kentucky bicentennial bookshelf)</h2><p>A biography of an outspoken Kentuckian who distinguised himself as a soldier, statesman, and an abolitionist.</p><p></p><h2>The &#34;Odessey&#34;: The Zombies in Words and Images</h2><p><p><strong>Released 50 years ago, and celebrated in this new book, the Zombies' final album <em>Odessey and Oracle</em> is a masterpiece of '60s rock </strong></p><p><em>I remember first hearing 'She&#x2019;s Not There' on the radio in my bedroom.

In an era overly focused on how to `do church,' their message is clear; we must take a closer look at the life of Jesus. If you want to jump back into authentic, New Testament discipleship, then take their challenge to recalibrate the mission and work of the church around the story of Jesus. As only true practitioners can, they provide an abundance of practical insights and inspiration."Frost and Hirsch challenge us to reinstate Jesus as the central focus of our spiritual lives--both as individual disciples and as communities of his people. The Jesus they present is not the domesticated Jesus that we learned about in Sunday school, but the "loving, wildly passionate, dangerous, radically merciful and always surprising" Jesus portrayed in the Gospels.

Through an unprecedented wealth of details--from the day-to-day running of a huge empire to his clothes, cats, and bedroom habits--the private and public faces of a pharaoh are vividly brought to life as never before.<br> Joann Fletcher explores Amenhotep's private and public life in a compelling year-by-year account, drawing on firsthand and previously unpublished material. Among the many subjects covered are his daily schedule, such as bedchamber ceremonies and meetings with ministers; his relations with rulers of other ancient superpowers, recorded in a lively correspondence covering topics from new wives to the price of silver; his family life, including the remarkable role of his wife, Queen Tiy; the superlative art of the reign; and his monumental construction projects--among them the great temple of Luxor. Amenhotep III also established the cult of Aten, the sun disk, and after Amenhotep's death his son, the rebel pharaoh Akhenaten, became fanatically obsessed with the god. <br> Illustrated with spectacular full-color photographs, maps, and artifacts, many of which are published here for the first time, <em>Chronicle of a Pharaoh</em> provides the full context for understanding the monarch who presided over the magnificent flowering of Egyptian civilization.</p><p><br><strong>Joann Fletcher</strong> is a freelance Egyptologist. She teaches Egyptology throughout the United Kingdom and lectures for the University of London, the British Museum, the Egypt Explorations Society (in London and Cairo). She is also a consultant to a number of museums and to the Bioanthropology Foundation, for which she has undertaken the examination of royal mummies in Cairo.<br>This attractive, richly illustrated little book relates the life of Amenhotep III, who ruled Egypt in the 14th century B.C.E. He was a remarkable figure, and during his reign, Egypt was the world superpower, enjoying unparalleled economic growth and peace, both at home and with its neighbors. Amenhotep was a brilliant politician, best known today as the builder of the magnificent temple of Luxor and the royal palace of Malkata. Yet Fletcher, a well-known freelance Egyptologist based in England, focuses equally on some of the more intimate details of Amenhotep's life. She has organized the book in short chapters, each corresponding to roughly one year of Amenhotep's life, allowing Fletcher to present a plethora of extraordinary documents, paintings and sculptures that shed light on specific problems or events of Amenhotep's reign. For example, she includes charming details of the pharaoh's three jubilee festivals, and examines how he mourned the death of his loved ones and his marriage to the remarkable Queen Tiy. In addition, the author presents fascinating details of her subject's diplomatic relations with neighboring states and of how Amenhotep utilized religion to bolster his reign. The essential weakness of the format, however, is that it breaks up the narrative, thus losing an analytical edge. The book could also have benefited from a summary introduction or conclusion. Strengths outweigh weaknesses, however, in this aesthetically pleasing, small volume that imparts a taste of Amenhotep's persona, making the reader feel closer to this figure who lived so long ago.

The caddies in his group shared a look, knowing there was no way President Leary had broken a hundred, even if you ignored the water ball on hole number six, the &#x201c;gimme&#x201d; he putted anyway&#x2014;and missed&#x2014;on eleven, and the fact he&#x2019;d played the entire round with sixteen clubs in his bag, two over the limit. His regular Sunday morning playing partners had given up years ago on the prospect of ever winning a bet against the Leader of the Free World, seeing the six-hour saga as yet another tax on the rich.<br>The president had, in turn, given up years ago on the idea of spending his Sunday morning in the front pew of St. John&#x2019;s Church in Lafayette Square. For one thing, it was boring as hell. For another, the pastor wouldn&#x2019;t let him smoke during the sermon.<br>Confident of his read, he tossed his cigarette to the ground and settled over the knee-knocker. The sun bounced off his hair, vibrant and flawless, the color of a freshly minted penny. Sweat beaded off his freckled Irish skin. <i>Left edge and firm,</i> he reminded himself. His putter was halfway back to the ball when the BlackBerry in his pocket buzzed, sending his Titleist wobbling wide right, never scaring the cup. &#x201c;Damn it!&#x201d; he barked. &#x201c;That didn&#x2019;t count!&#x201d; The sprawling red-roofed clubhouse was a hundred yards away, but the outburst easily carried, loud enough to cause an elderly member to spill her hollandaise sauce as she lunched on the patio with her Jamaican nurse. Leary raked the ball back and tried again, this time missing left.<br>The president&#x2019;s short game wasn&#x2019;t the only thing in the crapper. It had been two years since he declared America&#x2019;s Great Recession over and the Great <i>Recovery</i> in full swing, a speech that culminated with a balloon drop (eco-friendly, of course), a blast of confetti (biodegradable), and a rousing rendition of Neil Diamond&#x2019;s &#x201c;America&#x201d; sung by the cast of the hit TV show <i>Glee.</i> There was just one problem&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t true.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t for lack of effort. In the three and a half years Leary had been in office, he&#x2019;d funneled over four trillion federal dollars to troubled banks, upside-down homeowners, and mismanaged corporations. In cases where free money couldn&#x2019;t rescue a company or a mortgage, the government went ahead and bought it outright. The thinking was that the backing of Washington, D.C., would free up credit and ease everyone&#x2019;s fears, like a rich parent&#x2019;s signature on an apartment lease. Leary&#x2019;s intentions appeared good, his commitment unwavering, but the president&#x2019;s Keynesian approach had not delivered.<br>Instead, the sick economy he thought he was reviving had been suffocated by wasteful spending, increased regulations, and a general demonization of free market capitalism. Wary investors dumped stock and ran to gold. Small business owners ignored Washington pleas to hire new workers and sat on what capital they still had. Entire housing developments stood empty. Others were bulldozed and returned back to nature. Inflation was on the rise, the dollar was dying, and the unions, the president&#x2019;s most loyal voting bloc, had taken to the streets with increasing violence to make it known that if anyone was going to take a cut in pay or in benefits, it would not be any of them.<br>The world was losing faith in America.

Not in a friendly way, but more in the way you like someone who is putty in your hands. In public, he referred to Allen and similar Republicans as open-minded, reasoned, and, if he was feeling especially charitable that day, bipartisan. Guys like Allen ate that stuff up for some reason. In most cases, it was because their wives were secretly Democrat and the husbands could use compliments from the other side of the aisle as proof they weren&#x2019;t complete monsters. In private, the administration simply referred to people like Allen as ETs. Easy Targets. <i>Damn it all,</i> Leary thought.

Duffy.</p><h2>Standing in the Sun: A Life of J.M.W. Turner</h2><p>Back in print after a decade, this book, which A. S. Byatt called &#x201c;a pleasure to read,&#x201d; explores the life of J. M. W. Turner (1775&#x2013;1851), Britain&#x2019;s most mysterious painter, whose range of work encompasses seascapes and landscapes, executed in both immensely powerful oil paintings and intimate watercolors. Anthony Bailey crafts what the <i>Guardian</i> called a &#x201c;very fine portrait&#x201d; of Turner, the short and stout son of a Covent Garden barber, who achieved fame and fortune during his lifetime and whose works remain enormously popular and influential today. Bailey &#x201c;writes with flair and imagination&#x201d; (<i>Sunday Times</i>), using archival material, scholarly literature and research, and many of Turner&#x2019;s sketchbooks, paintings, and watercolors to shed new light on this complicated and secretive artistic figure.</p><p><b>Anthony Bailey&#x2019;s</b> books include <i>Rembrandt&#x2019;s House</i>, a biographical study of another great painter; the novel <i>Major Andr�</i>; and memoirs from America and England.</p><h2>Faceless Killers: A Mystery</h2><p>Inspector Kurt Wallander, a local Swedish police officer whose own personal life is falling apart, finds himself coping with a wave of anti-foreigner sentiment when he is put in charge of the investigation into the brutal murders of an elderly couple</p><p>If you remember with pleasure those dark and gloomy Martin Beck mysteries by Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo, you&#39;ll be glad to plunge into the first of Henning Mankell&#39;s Kurt Wallender mysteries to appear in English. Wallender&#39;s personal life can occasionally seem more depressing than even a provincial Swedish detective should be asked to bear, but his investigative skills are strictly first rate. And Mankell&#39;s story of the brutal murder of an elderly farm couple uncovers an unusual aspect of life in modern Sweden--a streak of fear and prejudice against the many newcomers from Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe who have sought asylum there.First in the Kurt Wallander series. <br>It was a senselessly violent crime: on a cold night in a remote Swedish farmhouse an elderly farmer is bludgeoned to death, and his wife is left to die with a noose around her neck. And as if this didn't present enough problems for the Ystad police Inspector Kurt Wallander, the dying woman's last word is "foreign, leaving the police the one tangible clue they have-and in the process, the match that could inflame Sweden's already smoldering anti-immigrant sentiments. <br>Unlike the situation with his ex-wife, his estranged daughter, or the beautiful but married young prosecuter who has peaked his interest, in this case, Wallander finds a problem he can handle. He quickly becomes obsessed with solving the crime before the already tense situation explodes, but soon comes to realize that it will require all his reserves of energy and dedication to solve.</p><h2>Convoy Will Scatter: The Full Story of Jervis Bay and Convoy HX84</h2><p>On 5 November 1940 the eastbound convoy HX 84 of thirty-seven merchant ships, escorted by the armed merchant cruiser HMS Jervis Bay was attacked in mid-Atlantic by the German pocket battleship Admiral Scheer. The Jervis Bay, commanded by Captain Edward Fegen, charged at the enemy. Hopelessly outgunned, she was blown out of the water by the Scheer&#x2019;s 11-inch guns.<br><br>Meanwhile, led by HX 84&#x2019;s commodore ship, the Cardiff tramp Cornish City, the merchantmen scattered under the cover of a smoke screen, were picked off one by one by the radar-equipped Admiral Scheer.<br><br>Captain Hugh Pettigrew, commanding the highly armed Canadian Pacific cargo liner Beaverford, began a desperate game of hide and seek with the Scheer, which continued until Beaverford was sunk with no survivors. Thanks to this sacrifice, incredibly, only four other merchantmen were sunk.<br><br>Later the neutral flag Swedish freighter Stureholm, commanded by Captain Olander, picked up survivors from the Jervis Bay. Without this brave and dangerous gesture no one would have lived to tell the tale of the death throes of the Jervis Bay, whose Captain was awarded the VC.<br><br>Sadly, the history books only mention the Beaverford and the Stureholm in passing. This thrilling book puts the record straight.</p><p>Bernard Edwards pursued a sea-going career commanding ships trading worldwide. After nearly forty years afloat. Captain Edwards settled in a tiny village in rural South Wales, to pursue his second career as a writer. His extensive knowledge of the sea and ships has enabled him to produce many authentic and eminently readable books which have received international recognition.This book brings to life the bravery of the men on convoy HX 84 and the sacrifice of a few which saved many and allowed the bulk of the convoy to carry on to Port with their precious cargo. How when out gunned the Captain of Jervis Bay attacked the Battleship Admiral Scheer and in doing so saved many more lives while laying down his and the crews. This is the story of how the sheer determination and bravery of the Navy were able to fight and protect Convoy HX 84 meaning that out of 37 merchant ships that only 4 merchant ships were sunk. As the veterans of the Atlantic battles and convoys are now on their final journeys to another life it is now more important to record the debt we owe, Bernard Edwards records this in Convoy Will Scatter.This book is a well researched historical record of Convoy HX 84 and those men who gave their lives in the service to protect us and as the years slip by this book will become more important because those who paid the ultimate price deserve to have their story remembered and not forgotten in the depths of the ocean or time.

It is known that&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing upon Earth is forever; geography, climate, and&nbsp;&nbsp;plant and animal life are all subject to radical&nbsp;&nbsp;change. On five occasions in the past, catastrophic&nbsp;&nbsp;natural events have caused mass extinctions on&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth. But today humans stand alone, in dubious&nbsp;&nbsp;distinction, among Earth's species: <i>Homo&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapiens</i> possesses the ability to destroy&nbsp;&nbsp;entire species at will, to trigger the sixth&nbsp;&nbsp;extinction in the history of life. In <i>The Sixth&nbsp;&nbsp;Extinction</i>, Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin&nbsp;&nbsp;consider how the grand sprawl of human life is&nbsp;&nbsp;inexorably wreaking havoc around the world. The&nbsp;&nbsp;authors of <i>Origins</i> and&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Origins Reconsidered</i>, unimpeachable&nbsp;&nbsp;authorities on the human fossil record, turn their&nbsp;&nbsp;attention to the most uncharted anthropological territory&nbsp;&nbsp;of all: the future, and man's role in defining it.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Leakey and Lewin, man and his&nbsp;&nbsp;surrounding species are end products of history and&nbsp;&nbsp;chance. Now, however, humans have the unique&nbsp;&nbsp;opportunity to recognize their influence on the global&nbsp;&nbsp;ecosystem, and consciously steer the outcome in order&nbsp;&nbsp;to avoid triggering an unimaginable upheaval.</p><p><b>Richard Leakey</b> is the world&#x2019;s most famous living paleoanthropologist. He resigned from his position as chairman of the National Museums of Kenya when&nbsp;Kenya&#x2019;s president, Daniel arap Moi appointed him to head the Kenya Wildlife Service.&nbsp;His parents were the archaeologists Louis Leakey and Mary Leakey. His half-brother is the leading plant scientist, Colin Leakey.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Roger Lewin</b>, <b>PhD,&nbsp;</b>is a biochemist, the former deputy editor of the British magazine&nbsp;<i>New Scientist</i>, and the author of <i>Making Waves: Irving Dardik and His Superwave Principle</i>, as well as many other highly praised books on biology such as <i>Complexity: Life at the Edge of Chaos</i> and <i>Patterns in Evolution: The New Molecular View</i>.Paleoanthropologist Leakey and coauthor Lewin (Origins Reconsidered, LJ 9/1/92) examine biology's traditional viewpoints, which maintain a linear progression from simple to complex species development. In this scenario, survival of the fittest means success, and species extinction indicates failure. The authors also present the current trends in evolutionary science theory suggesting that the world is shaped by mass extinctions (natural catastrophes have caused five) instead of natural selection and that the shape and behavior of biological communities is driven by chaotic interaction rather than the simplistic balance-of-nature concept. Leakey and Lewin argue that Homo sapiens is the result of many chance events in evolution rather than the foreordained culmination of evolutionary excellence. Unfortunately, our self-awareness and mental capacity has given us the dubious capability of triggering a sixth extinction, destroying entire species through overhunting and habitat destruction. As the only sentient creature among animals, we have the duty to protect all of Earth's species. The authors present a powerful message based on years of observation and fieldwork.

What a waste of time! There&#x2019;s so much more important stuff to do! Plus, baths are super dangerous for a number of reasons. You want me to list a few? Most household accidents happen in the bathroom. Scientific fact! A kid in Texas turned into a prune after taking a bath. Scientific fact!<br> &nbsp;<br> If you need more evidence, allow me to point you to an excellent book called <i>101 Reasons Why I'm Not Taking a Bath</i>. It&#x2019;s full of insightful and logical reasons why you should definitely not be subjected to this useless ritual. Joy Ang and Stacy McAnulty really understand how dumb baths are, and have done a top-notch job of demonstrating why.</p><p>STACY McANULTY loves taking baths; it's her children who inspired this story. She's the author of<b>&nbsp;Excellent Ed</b>, illustrated by Julia&nbsp;Sarcone-Roach and the chapter book series,&nbsp;<b>The Dino Files</b>. She lives in North Carolina with her messy husband, their three smelly kids, and two stinky dogs. <br> &nbsp;<br>JOY ANG is a freelance artist who has illustrated children's books and works as a character designer on the TV show <i>Adventure Time. </i>She graduated from the Alberta College of Art and Design with a Bachelor of Design in 2007. Her most recent picture books include <i>Mustache Baby</i> and <i>Mustache Baby Meets His Match</i>.A filth-encrusted gamin ticks off precisely why a trip to the tub is&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;on the list of priorities. Sporting grimy skin and twiggy hair, a brown-haired, fair-skinned child decides to list the 101 reasons why bathing is not an appealing option. Starting with &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not dirty&#x201d; and proceeding from there, the grubby kid plays every card in the deck. McAnulty manages to keep the action hopping in a narrative that really is just a very long list. There are the expected excuses (&#x201c;Monsters live in the drain&#x201d;), the unexpected (&#x201c;I have a self-cleaning button like the oven&#x201d;&#x2014;that would be a bellybutton), and the downright clever (&#x201c;Most household accidents happen in the bathroom. Scientific fact!&#x201d;). When confronted with the kicker that only 88 reasons have been listed (a sly twist adults won&#x2019;t see coming), the child responds with an additional 13 repetitions of &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to&#x201d; (the title of the book isn&#x2019;t&nbsp;<i>101&nbsp;<b>Unique</b>&nbsp;Reasons Why I&#x2019;m NOT Taking a Bath</i>, after all). In the end bathtime is achieved, and the child has a sudden change of heart. Ang provides a peppy visual narrative to pair with the extensive monologue, though, alas, the art never quite reaches the levels of eclectic, original insanity the text leaves openings for. There&#x2019;s really only one reason to read this book: it&#x2019;s a hoot. &#x2014; <i>Kirkus Reviews (5/27/16)</i></p><h2>Murder at the Flamingo: A Novel (A Van Buren and DeLuca Mystery)</h2><p><p><strong><em>&#x201c;Maybe it was time to land straight in the middle of the adventure...&#x201d;</em></strong></p><p>Hamish DeLuca has spent most of his life trying to hide the anxiety that appears at the most inopportune times -- including during his first real court case as a new lawyer.

Coe is Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University. His books include The Maya, Mexico, Breaking the Maya Code, Angkor and the Khmer Civilization, and&nbsp;Reading the Maya Glyphs. He lives in New Haven, Connecticut.The decipherment of the Maya script was, Coe states, "one of the most exciting intellectual adventures of our age, on a par with the exploration of space and the discovery of the genetic code." He presents the story eloquently and in detail, with many illustrations of the mysterious Maya inscriptions and the people who tried to decipher them. Most of the credit, he says, goes to the late Yuri V. Knorosov of the Russian Institute of Ethnography, but many others participated. They did not always agree, and some of them went up blind alleys. Coe--emeritus professor of anthropology at Yale University--vividly describes the battles, missteps and successes. What is now established, he writes, is that "the Maya writing system is a mix of logograms and syllabic signs; with the latter, they could and often did write words purely phonetically." <p> Coe concludes with a swipe at "dirt archaeologists" who believe the decipherment of Maya writing "is not worthy of notice." According to them, he asserts, "the Maya inscriptions are 'epiphenomenal,' a ten-penny word meaning that Maya writing is only of marginal application since it is secondary to those more primary institutions--economy and society--so well studied by the dirt archaeologists." Coe sees that attitude as "sour grapes" and ascribes it to "the inability or unwillingness of anthropologically trained archaeologists to admit that they are dealing with the remains of real people, who once lived and spoke."</p></p><h2>Elbert, the Curious Clock Tower Bear</h2><p><b><b>An inquisitive bear discovers the wonders of the world around him in this utterly charming picture book that celebrates curiosity, asking questions, and being true to yourself.</b></b><br><br>Unlike the other mechanical bears in the village clock tower, Elbert can't help but notice all the marvelous things around him--snow falling in winter, fireworks in the night sky, the magnificent stag standing in the cobbled street below. But when Elbert's growing curiosity threatens to disrupt the orderly life of the clock tower, the other bears decide Elbert must go. What's a small bear with a big curiosity to do? Explore, of course! And maybe even find a way to spread his inquisitive spirit. Here's the perfect book for readers young and old who believe that staying curious is more important than following the rules.</p><p>Andrew Prahin is the author of the picture book <i>Brimby's Hats,</i> which received two starred reviews. He lives and works in Chicago. Learn more at andrewprahin.com. Follow him on Twitter @AndrewPrahin.K-Gr 2-Elbert is one of five mechanical bears who live in a clock tower, and parade around the clock, at the stroke of every hour. Yet, Elbert has many questions beyond his duties. The other bears become irritated with Elbert&#39;s wonder and give him an ultimatum: get rid of his curiosity in 24 hours or do not return to the clock tower. As Elbert journeys through a town and the forest to rid himself of his questions, he discovers he only has more wonder and awe for possibility. Beautifully written and illustrated, this book is a delight with a powerful message about remaining curious. Elbert&#39;s countdown appears on alternating pages, with the clock tower&#39;s face displaying the time, which could be useful in helping young readers learning to tell time. The text is full of lush vocabulary and deep thinking, pondering where curiosity lives in the body. The illustrations mimic the movement of Elbert&#39;s journey and his thought process, whether appearing as panels demonstrating the progression of time as he moves through the forest, or as full-page illustrations conveying Elbert&#39;s pausing to think as he takes in the view on a mountain top. VERDICT While the questions posed, vocabulary, and symbolism could be tricky for some readers, the overall story and emotion behind it is one that is worthwhile to any reader young or old.-Kaitlin Malixi, Kensington Health Sciences Academy, Philadelphia</p><h2>Waterloo: The Campaign of 1815: Volume II - From Waterloo to the Restoration of Peace in Europe</h2><p>Winner of the 2019 RUSI Duke of Wellington Medal for Military History<br>Winner of the 2017 Society for Army Historical Research Templer Medal<br><br>The concluding volume of this work provides a fresh description of the climatic battle of Waterloo placed in the context of the whole campaign.

Various religious beliefs are presented, with a focus on pagan funeral rituals and meditations.</p><p>My roommate laughed when he saw that I was reviewing this book, but after I pointed out how close he is to his cat, he looked at the book more seriously.

Rather than repressing the emotions that surround a pet's death, Harris encourages her readers to express the pain they feel and the love they remember.Eleanor Harris is an experienced grief counselor for pet loss.

The illustrations, many in splendid color, are taken from manuscripts and books chronicling human curiosity about the medicinal properties of plants, and making an unconscious record, through the strange (sometimes ludicrous) customs and procedures they describe, of life in past times.</p><p>As more gardeners become interested in growing herbs, a general curiosity about herbal lore is increasing. This expanded version of an important book traces the origins of those ancient illustrated compendiums of plants known as herbals. And despite their obvious scholarship, Blunt and Raphael have put together a readable account. Delving into essential changes in the depictions of herbs, they cite early Greek texts and then move on to an eighteenth-century French <i>herbier</i> and British botanical texts. These fascinating sources--gleaned from the archives of numerous libraries and museums--have yielded simple, stylized drawings and exquisitely detailed engravings and paintings, presenting much to be savored. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>American Impressionism and Realism: The Painting of Modern Life, 1885-1915</h2><p>An examination of the continuities and differences between American Impressionism and Realism.</p><p></p><h2>If Apples Had Teeth</h2><p><p>A book about language, play, and the relationship between words and images, <i>If Apples Had Teeth</i> is graphic, smart, silly, and surreal all at the same time.

Allende offers a compelling saga of the turbulent history, lives, and loves of late 19th-century Chile, drawing on characters from her earlier novels, <i>The House of Spirits</i> and <i>Daughter of Fortune</i>.<p> In typical Allende fashion, <i>Portrait in Sepia</i> is crammed with love, desire, tragedy, and dark family secrets, all played out against the dramatic backdrop of revolutionary Chile. Our heroine Aurora del Valle's mother is a Chilean-Chinese beauty, while her father is a dissolute scion of the wealthy and powerful del Valle family. At the heart of Aurora's slow, painful re-creation of her childhood towers one of Allende's greatest fictional creations, the heroine's grandmother, Paulina del Valle. An "astute, bewigged Amazon with a gluttonous appetite," Paulina holds both the del Valle family and Allende's novel together as she presides over Aurora's adolescence in a haze of pastries, taffeta, and overweening love.</p><p> One of the most interesting aspects of the novel is Allende's decision to turn her heroine into a photographer: "through photography and the written word I try desperately to conquer the transitory nature of my existence, to trap moments before they evanesce, to untangle the confusion of my past."

Featuring design products, prototypes, and models, and part of a groundbreaking 2001 exhibition held at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, this exciting book introduces work concepts originated by internationally recognized designers who address the unique needs of specific work scenarios, including the nomadic office of a business traveler; the domestic office; the virtual office; and more traditional offices in settings configured for group interaction. Featuring projects commissioned especially for <i>Workspheres</i> by such avant-garde brainstormers as LOT/EK, Digital Image Design, and Hella Jongerius, interviews with designers extraordinaire Bruce Mau, Michael Brill, and Francis Duffy, and more pictures of chairs, cubicles, and desks that you've ever imagined, even in your most compulsive catalogue fantasies, <i>Workspheres</i> is the ultimate consideration of contemporary work space.</p><p>Paola Antonelli is Curator in the Department of Architecture and Design at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.Based on an exhibition of the same name currently on view at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, this book examines the role of design in the imagined workplace of the future and features work by an international selection of design teams. Five brief essays precede more than 100 pages of enticements for acquisitive workers, from Prada sport jackets to collapsible keyboards. The editor occasionally indulges in frivolity, as with Laurence Sarrazin's puzzlingly impractical banana-shaped zip-up tool cases. The essays focus on the effects of electronic technology and the promise of telecommuting, but also included here are Larry Keely's able review of workplace predictions since the 17th century and Christopher Budd's look at the office from 1950 to the present, an excellent exploration of how the ethos of a particular workplace is expressed in its design. The volume's chief asset is its numerous color illustrations, which serve as a catalog of the best of contemporary office furnishings and products. Though Workspheres lacks the freshness and spirited idealism of the museum's earlier and more compelling Italy: The New Domestic Landscape (1972 o.p.), it is still recommended for all design collections.

There have been Psalters in English since the Coverdale translation of Psalms was first introduced in the Book of Common Prayer s 1662 revision. With the adoption of Lutheran Service Book, there is a need for a new Psalter, using modern English and more contemporary musical settings. Using the same translation and setting of the psalms in daily devotions and Sunday worship has a great advantage for learning and memorizing the psalms. Each psalm has been pointed and psalm tones have been provided for easy reference. To aid in meditation of the Psalms, short prayers accompany each psalm.</p><p>The theology of the Reformation is filled with the language of the psalms. This was no accident. As a friar, Luther sang and prayed the entire psalter often. The Psalms are meant for singing in public and private personal worship. Presenting the ESV psalter with new and well-known Lutheran Service Book psalm tones and concluding psalm prayers, the Concordia Psalter is an ideal resource for praying and singing the church&#39;s first hymnal. After all, it is true that he who sings prays twice. Our Lord Jesus knew the psalms well. He still prays for His church. Recover regular use of the psalter in your own prayer life with Concordia Psalter. --Rev.

During her lifetime Ravenel collected more than two hundred receipts from Charleston ladies of her acquaintance. Editor Elizabeth Ravenel Harrigan, great-niece of Rose P. Ravenel, has put together a selection from her ancestor&#39;s notebooks to re-create twelve delicious Charlestonian meals and to capture memories of Charleston before and after the Civil War. Also included are drawings by Ravenel and her friend Lisa Huger Smith.</p><p>A compendium of historical lowcountry recipes and tales of their usesElizabeth Ravenel Harrigan is a native of Charleston and grew up on Farmfield Farm, the Ravenel property.

Their connections to the genres they have been radically redefining have, for many of these writers, limited the appreciation of their accomplishments to a specialized readership. For example, though John Crowley and Jonathan Carroll have massive underground reputations, and Peter Straub has written two books with Stephen King and other bestselling novels such as <i>Ghost Story, Koko,</i> and <i>The Throat</i>, many if not most readers of <i>Conjunctions</i> will be unfamiliar with their work. In this haunting and beautiful collection of tales, Crowley, Carroll and Straub join Elizabeth Hand, China Mieville, M. John Harrison, Neil Gaiman and Kelly Link to demonstrate precisely how science fiction, fantasy and horror have been unobtrusively colonizing serious literature during the past 20 years. As an added bonus, science fiction and fantasy experts Gary K. Wolfe and John Clute offer a critical perspective and explain everything in sight.

Cage and Gregory M. Tomlin deployed to Baquba, Iraq, on a mission that would redefine how conventional U.S. military forces fight an urban war. Having led artillery units through a transition into anti-insurgent rifle companies and carrying out daily combat patrols in one of the region&#x2019;s most notorious hotspots, Cage and Tomlin chronicle Task Force 1-6 Field Artillery&#x2019;s year on the ground in Iraq and its response to the insurgency that threatened to engulf their corner of the Sunni Triangle.<br><br> Rather than presenting a snapshot dominated by battle scenes, The Gods of Diyala presents a wide-angled view of the experiences of Cage and Tomlin and their comrades-in-arms. They assess the implications of their experiences, starting with their pre-deployment training in Germany and ending with the handing over of duties to their replacement brigade at the close of their tour of duty. They discuss frankly their impressions of the benefits and liabilities of working with embedded journalists and relate both their frustrations with and their admiration for the fledgling Iraqi security forces. From chaotic security planning to personal debates on the principles of democracy, both authors discuss how Iraqis perceived the value of their first post-Saddam elections and the political future of their country as it tries to reinvent itself in the wake of a dictator&#x2019;s fall.<br><br> The Gods of Diyala gives a new and personal perspective on the second stage of the ongoing war in Iraq. Students and scholars of military history will find its insights meaningful and informative, and general readers will enjoy its thoughtful, well-measured narratives of a year spent trying to protect a fragile nation as it struggled toward democracy.</p><p>CALEB S.

Scholars of the war will read it to understand the mechanics of counter-insurgency in 2004/5. Those in the military will read it to compare their experiences to those of Cage and Tomlin.

From 1998 to 2006, I spent about three years bumping around India, Tibet, and Nepal, first as a student on an abroad program learning about Indian and Tibetan folklore, and later in backpacker hostels on the beaches of Goa and the mountain valleys of Kathmandu. Later, I dropped out of a PhD program in anthropology to lead an abroad program for American students that advertised in glossy brochures with the catchy title &#x201c;India: From Brahma to Buddha.&#x201d; I was excited to help guide young people on their journeys in a foreign land.</p><p>The highlight of the program was a ten-day silent meditation retreat in the rustic town of Bodh Gaya, the spot where Buddha achieved enlightenment while sitting under a fig tree almost three millennia ago. We studied an introductory program known in Tibetan as <i>lamrim</i> to learn about the karmic cycle of death and rebirth and to cultivate an attitude of compassion for all living things. We were told that this could lead the way to happiness in this life&#x2014;and perhaps enlightenment in our next.</p><p>I began studying Tibetan Buddhism on my first trip to Asia and it had helped me find my own answers to some of life&#x2019;s big questions. Its focus on mortality made me realize that no matter what we believe happens after death, our time on this earth is precious. Buddhists reflect openly on death and teach that although all life ends in tragedy, the way we use our lives does not have to be meaningless. Every moment has value and meditation is one way to capture life&#x2019;s fleetingness.</p><p>The first seven days of the retreat consisted mainly of breathing exercises and lectures on the Tibetan worldview. On the eighth day, the experience turned dark. The Swiss-German nun who was our instructor told us to imagine that we were decaying corpses and that the bodies of everyone we knew were bags of human shit. The exercise, which is meant to help the students develop psychic tools to use when they eventually face their own death, might sound extreme, but Tibetan meditation can get even more far-out: A practice known as <i>ch�d</i> involves meditating over actual decaying corpses in a graveyard.</p><p>When the meditations were over, I had a conversation with one of my students&#x2014;a whip-smart twenty-one-year-old Southern belle named Emily O&#x2019;Conner (not her real name)&#x2014;about her experiences.* She said it was the most profoundly moving experience of her life and that &#x201c;maybe more silence would have been better.&#x201d;</p><p>That night, while the other students chatted enthusiastically in the meditation room, she climbed to the roof of one of the dormitories, wrapped a <i>khadi</i> scarf around her face, and jumped. A student on his way to bed found her facedown on the pavement. According to the coroner&#x2019;s report, she had died on impact.</p><p>I was charged with returning her remains to America. Somewhere along the way, the Indian police gave me her journal. On the eighth day of the retreat, she&#x2019;d written in flowery, well-constructed cursive, &#x201c;Contemplating my own death is the key.&#x201d; Then, a few paragraphs later, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m scared that I will have this realization and go crazy.&#x201d; One of the last things Emily wrote, in the same steady hand, was &#x201c;I am a Bodhisattva&#x201d;&#x2014;an enlightened being that Tibetans aspire to become. She believed she was well along the road to transcendence.</p><p>There are many explanations for why Emily, my student, decided to take her own life. Maybe she had misunderstood the meaning of &#x201c;enlightenment.&#x201d; Maybe she had underlying mental instabilities that just happened to manifest themselves during intensive meditation. For all I knew, she <i>was</i> a Bodhisattva and continuing on her journey in another realm. However, here on earth I worried that enlightenment might not be all that it promised.</p><p>The experience changed my life, turning me toward a career as an investigative journalist. As I recounted in my book <i>The Red Market: On the Trail of the World&#x2019;s Organ Brokers, Bone Thieves, Blood Farmers, and Child Traffickers</i>, my fight to preserve her body with ice and embalming fluid against the inevitability of decay made me consider the subtle line that separates the flesh of a corpse from that of a living person. Without that mysterious animating force that some people might call a soul, our bodies are little more than meat. Out of a living context, that meat is a sort of commodity in the eyes of the world. For the next five or six years, I followed that realization to what, for me, were its logical conclusions. I became a journalist and explored the growing, illegal markets for bodies and body parts.</p><p>Even as I pursued criminals across international lines, I often drifted back to the question of why my student took her life. For me, it was more difficult to understand how a technique that was supposed to make someone a more compassionate person could have such a tragic result.</p><p>The death of a second meditator, Ian Thorson, this time in the mountains of Arizona, made me suspect that there was an unspoken mystery at the heart of these transformational techniques. There was no doubt that his death and Emily&#x2019;s were rare events&#x2014;perhaps even within the statistical norms for suicide or murder in a given population. But there were eerie similarities.</p><p>Was there something in the teachings that drives some people to madness? Could silence itself be damaging? Or was it something about the way Westerners think about Eastern spirituality that makes us particularly susceptible to grandiose expectations? When not tempered, perhaps that search for something greater than ourselves is enough to push some people past a breaking point.</p><p>I began my investigation expecting to uncover a hidden dark side of meditation and yoga that gets swept under the rug. People who adhere to Eastern teachings might be inclined to explain away negative events as the fault of the individual and not of the techniques. To some degree, that <i>is</i> what I found. But I also found something stranger. Maybe instead of thinking of spiritual practices as something in and of themselves good or bad, it is more fruitful to think of them as potentially powerful.</p><p>Whatever gets unlocked in the meditation chamber, a prayer hall, or a yoga studio is certainly deeply personal, physical, psychological, and subject to the grand sweep of history. There is also something about it that is transcendent, and essential to who we are as humans.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Prologue</p><p><i>The Cave</i></p><p>CHRISTIE MCNALLY&#x2019;S HAIR hung down in greasy unwashed cords as she scanned the retreat valley with her tired brown eyes. The searing yellow flashlight beams hadn&#x2019;t cut across the tract for at least a week, but that didn&#x2019;t mean their pursuit was over. A month earlier, devotees had bowed at her feet and laid garlands of flowers on her throne. Now guards patrolled the property line, wary of any attempt she might make to reassert control of her flock. Her white robes, long since soiled, were packed away in one of the watertight Rubbermaid tubs that they&#x2019;d stashed beneath the cave they now occupied.</p><p>There were still a few of their loyal Buddhist followers out there somewhere. She&#x2019;d written a message to them in a bubbly girlish scrawl. Her struggle had a place in the grand sweep of history of the landscape. They&#x2019;d been expelled from their own slice of Eden and hounded so that she and her husband, Ian Thorson, had &#x201c;started to feel this terrible sense of being hunted, like a wild rabbit, or perhaps like an Apache of long ago.&#x201d; It was an apt metaphor. A hundred and fifty years earlier, Indians armed with rifles and stolen ammunition squatted on a ridge not far from here. They watched the valley as Union soldiers refreshed their canteens at Bear Spring and waited for the perfect moment to strike. As the soldiers quenched their thirst, the reports of Apache rifles echoed off the canyon walls. Two bullets found their mark. The privates bled out within minutes; their blue uniforms turned purple and the ground soaked up their blood as greedily as it did their spilled canteens. The lieutenant survived to record their passing in a report to his commanding officer at Fort Bowie, whose low adobe walls stood only a quarter mile away.</p><p>The murders were just another step in the tit-for-tat violence that culminated in seventy-five years of barbarism known by the victors as the Indian Wars. Vestiges of that violence remained when McNally helped raise money to buy the valley in 2008 and rechristen it Diamond Mountain. Bear Spring silted over and stopped flowing only a few months after the Buddhists arrived. Some locals thought it was a sign.</p><p>When they moved here, McNally and Thorson saw the cave as a spiritual refuge in the tradition of the great Himalayan masters. Their plan was as elegant as it was treacherous: They would occupy the cave until they achieved enlightenment. They didn&#x2019;t expect that they might die trying.</p><p>Ian Thorson was thin now. Too thin, really. The knife wounds in his sides and shoulders had healed cleanly, but now a fresh bruise swept across his forehead. He&#x2019;d been delirious for some time, and in his frustration he&#x2019;d smashed his head with a piece of hardened plastic. It wasn&#x2019;t his fault that the situation didn&#x2019;t make sense anymore. She worried about him hurting himself further. Then again, he was so close to greatness.</p><p>McNally knew that when he looked up from the mattress they&#x2019;d hauled up to their mountain cave, he wouldn&#x2019;t see the guileless face of the girl who grew up outside of Los Angeles: the product of an affair between her father and his secretary. Nor would he identify the outline of the woman with whom he&#x2019;d helped build Diamond Mountain University into a major site for Tibetan Buddhist meditation. It was not the woman with whom he&#x2019;d spent countless hours perfecting the intricate postures of couples yoga, where they would use each other&#x2019;s weight to push their bodies into impossible configurations. She certainly wasn&#x2019;t the ex-wife of his first guru and spiritual teacher, Geshe Michael Roach, who was still jealously stewing over their controversial split. No. When he gazed out of the dimming aperture of the cave, he would see an angel made of clear white light. Christie McNally was his lover and his lama, the enlightened being who had seen the nature of emptiness directly, who had married him and taken his tortured soul from a base understanding of the world to the cusp of his own transformation.</p><p>She was also his only hope for making it out of here alive.</p><p>Even if he could stand, the cave was barely tall enough for Thorson to be on his feet without craning his six-foot frame. During daytime, a small sliver of light filtered in through a hole in the roof where the rocks formed a cleft. It was stuffed with all the things they had thought they would need to survive a long haul. There were bags of basmati rice, bolts of clothing and cold-weather gear, flashlights and jars of Italian seasoning. A small ritual instrument hung from a hook in the rock ceiling. It was tuned like a Jamaican steel drum and helped ease them into meditation. They had propane, and Costco brand baby wipes, duct tape, Tibetan incense, a filtration device, and heavy black plastic bags full of junk. The only thing they didn&#x2019;t have was what they needed most: water.</p><p>Thick with poisonous snakes, mountain lions, and prickly cactus, the Chiricahua Mountains of Southeast Arizona are prone to landslides and are unforgiving to outsiders. Leaving the cave was an ordeal that left them exhausted and panting for breath. Since they&#x2019;d arrived a month ago, the temperature on the mountainside had been unpredictable. One day it would be hot enough to melt the soles of their hiking boots, the next a freak snowstorm might coat the rocks, yucca, and scrub oak with a fine layer of ice. Scorching desert winds whisked away what was left of their moisture.</p><p>Despite the lashing from the cold, they thought a recent ice storm was a blessing in disguise. It might have saved them from dehydration. When he still had some strength, Thorson arranged a tarp to collect the runoff from the melt and funnel it into a water jug that was long since dry. They drank from the impromptu reservoir, and the dirty container of water sat on the cave floor, bristling with twigs.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t long until Ian began to feel sick. His guts cramped and he began to shiver with fever. He donned three sweaters and crept beneath a blanket to beat the fever back, but it wasn&#x2019;t enough. His face turned from ghost white to a deep shade of purple.</p><p>They had three things that might help stave off the sickness. First, of course, there was the power of prayer. They&#x2019;d carved Tibetan words into a rock to sanctify the space and purify their spiritual path. Though meaningless in themselves, the syllables<i> om ah hung</i> in Tibetan invoked a powerful connection to their guru, which the holy texts said would restore their body, speech, and mind as well as balance the wheels of energy in their body, called <i>chakras</i>. Next to the carving was a course book devoted to Kali, the Hindu goddess of destruction. On its cover the bare-chested goddess clutched the severed head of an adversary and wore a skirt made of dismembered limbs. Kali is a fierce protector of her devotees, but she is known to take her payment in blood. Near the ritual accouterments was one more option: a sort of escape hatch if all else failed. Sheathed in orange plastic, the Satellite PersOnal Tracker, or SPOT, locator beacon was capable of sending out two prearranged distress calls. If Christie pressed the button marked HELP, their GPS coordinates would arc toward a geostationary satellite and into the in-boxes of their friends and family. A second button on the device, marked S.O.S., would summon the sheriff&#x2019;s department.</p><p>Christie stroked Ian&#x2019;s hair and it occurred to her that the illness could also be a lesson. Would he come back from the threshold of life and death with profound insight? Or would the journey kill him? Perhaps there was more to his illness than met the eye. It was entirely possible that he had been cursed by powerful black magic. She considered the tools arrayed in front of her. A protection mantra. The goddess Kali. An emergency beacon.</p><p>It was a test of faith informed by the fact that almost a decade earlier her teacher Michael Roach took her as a sexual consort and later as his wife. Roach was not the first white man to travel to India and come back claiming to be enlightened, but he looked the part better than any of his predecessors. Roach bestowed Christie with the Tibetan title of lama and ever since, hundreds of devotees bent at her feet. For them it meant she was a living goddess&#x2014;a sort of messiah for a new breed of Buddhism that had only just gained a foothold in America.</p><p>Now that they were on the run, Lama Christie McNally had to decide whether she would try to heal Thorson with her godlike powers or leave the responsibility to an outsider who would never understand that the path to enlightenment is not always straightforward. Or safe.</p><p>As Lama Christie&#x2019;s fi...</p></p><h2>Lincoln Day By Day - A Chronology 1809 - 1865</h2><p>1809-1865, Revised edition. Three volumes in one, introduction by Dr. Ralph G.

Look at the Astors and the Vanderbilts, all those big society people. They were the worst thieves - and now look at them. It's just a matter of time.&#x201d; &#x2013; Meyer Lansky <br> One of America&#x2019;s most infamous mobsters, Meyer Lansky, was also one of the most mysterious, a perplexing, yet inexplicably intriguing individual with multiple reputations. To his admirers, he was in many ways the ultimate genius and survivor within the callous and cut-throat world of 20th century organized crime. Even in adulthood, Meyer was smaller than most, standing anywhere between 4'11&#x201d; to 5'4&#x201d;, and weighing 136 pounds at his heaviest. He was not merely an intellectual &#x2013; he was worldly and wise, one who often doled out advice akin to poetry to his children and grandchildren, his gravelly voice oddly soothing. At the same time, he had all the stealth and cunning of a sphinx, and while remarkably even-tempered, gangsters twice his size dared not cross him. To them, he was no more than a wildly ambitious, often misunderstood entrepreneur who trod upon the border between legality and lawlessness with all the mastery of a tightrope artist. He was, above all, the definition of humility, one whose &#x201c;handshake was worth more than any contract,&#x201d; and a man who actively dodged the spotlight that doggedly tailed him until the end of his days. <br> Conversely, most will quickly concede that while Lansky was an exceptionally clever criminal, he was a criminal all the same, and the crimes of this dark horse were unforgivable. Meyer was a fraudulent, tax-evading crook whose massive fortune was literally made off the bodies of countless victims. He was a silver-tongued fiend who preyed on the weak and impressionable, plying them with booze and drugs and feeding their gambling addictions. <br> Lansky, whose most famous nickname remains the &#x201c;Mob&#x2019;s Accountant,&#x201d; was one of the few gangsters of his era to die in old age, and he was never pinched for anything more serious than gambling. It&#x2019;s believed he made upwards of $20 million in his time as a mobster, but some still claim he was never the mogul the media painted him out to be. Instead, they assert that he was an expendable middleman, and that he was an overzealous rogue who squandered away whatever fortune he had. <br> Meyer Lansky: The Infamous Life and Legacy of the Mob&#x2019;s Accountant profiles the controversial life of one of organized crime&#x2019;s most notorious figures. Along with pictures of important people, places, and events, you will learn about Meyer Lansky like never before.</p><p></p><h2>The Guide to Oklahoma Wildflowers (Bur Oak Guide)</h2><p><p></p>With its Rocky Mountain foothills, hardwood forests, many rivers and streams, low mountains, sand dunes, cypress swamps, and wide swaths of rangeland and pastureland, the Great Plains state of Oklahoma is one of only four with more than ten ecoregions. Tallgrass, mixed-grass, and shortgrass prairies are native to large areas; rainfall and temperature are quite variable; and elevations drop from 5,000 to 300 feet. This diversity ensures that Oklahoma is host to hundreds of species of wildflowers, yet no guidebook to these botanical riches has been available in recent years. Patricia Folley&#x2019;s beautifully photographed and carefully compiled <i>Guide to Oklahoma Wildflowers</i> fills this gap.&nbsp;Folley has photographed and described the two hundred wildflower species that are most commonly seen along roadsides and in parks throughout the state. She provides at least two photos for each plant, showing the entire plant as it occurs in the wild, outside of cultivation, along with a close-up of its flower. Each plant is keyed to a particular geographical location and a particular family, and an index to colors is a further aid to identification. If a species is native&#x2014;such as big bluestem, the defining grass of Oklahoma&#x2019;s tallgrass prairies&#x2014;Folley presents this information in the text along with time of blooming, size and color of blooms, preferred habitat, and common and scientific names for all species.&nbsp;Oklahoma contains vast plains, elevated rocky plateaus, and forested mountains. Botanizing one&#x2019;s way across the Sooner State reveals celestial lilies in the east, prickly poppies in the west, Dutchman&#x2019;s breeches in the northeast, large-flowered evening primrose in central and southwest areas, Indian pink in the southeast, walking-stick cholla in the Panhandle, and purple prairie clover statewide. Gardeners, teachers, tourists, and naturalists of all levels of expertise will enjoy this guide&#x2019;s concise text and vibrant photos.<p></p></p><p><p></p>Oklahoma native <b>Patricia Folley</b> has been identifying wildflowers in the field for more than thirty years. Formerly a logistics management instructor at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City, she is currently a herbarium assistant at the University of Oklahoma&#x2019;s Bebb Herbarium, a member of the Flora of Oklahoma editorial board, and coauthor of this evolving online project. A two-time former president of the Oklahoma Native Plant Society, she writes a monthly nature column for the <i>Norman Transcript</i> and is a technical editor for the <i>Oklahoma Native Plant Record</i>.

Julien Sorel, a young dreamer from the provinces whose imagination is afire with Napoleonic ideals, sets off to make his fortune in Parisian society of Restoration France. His encounters and experiences along the way incite constant inner conflict, drawing him back and forth between sincerity and hypocrisy, idealism and cynicism, humility and pride, love and ambition.</p><p>Stendhal<p><b>From Bruce Robbins&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>The Red and the Black</i></b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Climbing a ladder in the darkness, a young man is about to tap at the window of a woman&#x2019;s bedroom. This tableau, twice repeated in <i>The Red and the Black</i>, reveals two essential things about the novel. First, Julien Sorel is a social climber, on his way up in the world. And second, seducing the two women who become his lovers, both of them social superiors whose doors he cannot afford to be seen entering, turns out to be the major means of his social ascent.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reader is under no obligation to sympathize with this erotic agenda for career advancement, however accidentally the ambitious young protagonist falls into it, or for that matter with the protagonist himself. Again and again, especially in the scenes of romantic courtship, Stendhal takes pains to show Julien&#x2019;s conduct as animated, if that is the right word, by cold-blooded self-interest more than by genuine passion or desire. A military campaign aimed at conquering the enemy, one of Julien&#x2019;s favorite metaphors for what he is up to, is not a particularly appetizing way to think about love. Why then have generations of tenderhearted readers found this tough-minded novel so compelling?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin with, it is because Stendhal makes the reader feel how heavy the odds are against ascending the social ladder from the point where Julien starts out. The stubborn incomprehension Julien gets from his peasant father, while it falls somewhat short of monstrous tyranny, does set him up (like Charlotte Bront�&#x2019;s <i>Jane Eyre</i>) as a sort of nineteenth-century Cinderella: a suffering, sensitive, disadvantaged figure with whom it is almost impossible not to identify, at least at the outset. In bringing this fairy-tale structure forward into the dense, realistically observed detail of early-nineteenth-century France (the novel&#x2019;s subtitle is &#x201c;A Chronicle of 1830&#x201d;), Stendhal also puts French history itself to work in making his protagonist more palatable. Though the Revolution of 1830 is not in fact discussed&#x2014;the novel was finished before it broke out, and it was his publisher&#x2019;s idea, not Stendhal&#x2019;s, to use the subtitle<b> </b>to capitalize on reader interest in this topical and momentous event&#x2014;one can hardly avoid the sense of unbearably oppressive social weather on the eve of a devastating political thunderstorm. In the period after the defeats of Napol�on in 1813 and 1815, conventionally described as the Restoration (the monarchy was restored to power), the term &#x201c;reactionary&#x201d; was not a piece of mud-slinging hyperbole. Hard though it may be for a twenty-first-century reader to take in, the French Revolution&#x2019;s proposal that democracy should be realized in the world was still, to its opponents, unnatural and terrifying. The people who ruled France during the Restoration were self-consciously reacting against the democratic idea itself, and not merely against the violence of the terror with which that idea had been visited upon the king and the aristocracy. In restoring the monarchy, the rulers were restoring a natural social order in which, as God willed, one&#x2019;s place was determined by one&#x2019;s birth. Piety, hierarchy, and social immobility were cherished moral values of the age. Seen against this backdrop, Julien looks a lot more sympathetic. He seems to have little choice but to pretend he believes things he doesn&#x2019;t believe, like the dogmas of the church. If he wants to improve his lowly condition, history decrees he must be a hypocrite. In love, as in religion and politics, he must ignore the empty banalities he is fed and take a hungrily scientific interest in how the gears and levers of social power really work.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stendhal also softens our view of Julien by refusing to offer morally attractive alternatives. When Julien asserts that &#x201c;&#x2018;the people whom the world honors are merely villains who have had the good fortune not to have been caught red-handed&#x2019;&#x201d;, he is both a rebel against his time and, less obviously, a representaative of it. Behind the Restoration&#x2019;s pious fa�ade there was in fact significant social motion, even if such motion was deemed illegitimate and was officially denied. The increasing prosperity of Julien&#x2019;s shrewdly business-like father, which complicates the image of Julien&#x2019;s own rise as unique and unprecedented, is an obvious example, and there are others. An amoral skill in worldly matters&#x2014;what the French call <i>mondanit�</i>&#x2014;was prized even in ecclesiastical circles, as we see in Stendhal&#x2019;s accounts of priestly maneuverings over church titles and positions, over land, and, in the case of the Abb� Frilair&#x2019;s dishonorable intentions with regard to Mathilde, over sex. If Julien differs from the people around him, it is in part by being honest with himself, which is to say (given his place at the novel&#x2019;s center of consciousness) honest with us. And this honesty helps offset the impact his hypocrisy with others has on us.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To complicate matters further, Stendhal leaves us guessing as to whether Julien&#x2019;s career might after all embody some higher moral principle than merely getting ahead. What <i>are</i> the deep motives for his social ascent? When his father knocks Julien&#x2019;s book out of his hands and into the stream beneath the sawmill, the blow is struck not against reading as such; Julien&#x2019;s talent for memorizing Latin texts, which will do almost as much as his good looks to aid in his rise, has not been discouraged at home. Symbolically, the target is Julien&#x2019;s passionate attachment to the ideals and accomplishments of the French Revolution and its recently defeated hero, Napol�on. (The book he is absorbed in when caught by his father is a record of conversations with Napol�on from prison.) Stendhal, who had himself marched with Napol�on&#x2019;s armies in defense of the Revolution, made no secret of his own revolutionary loyalties. Dreaming of a greatness higher than his father&#x2019;s money-making, Julien acts out his author&#x2019;s feelings about the sordidness of Restoration France. And in so doing he also acts in the name of upward mobility, which one might have thought entirely consistent with money-making. &#x201c;Careers open to talent!&#x201d;, Napol�on&#x2019;s meritocratic motto, at that moment still sounded (mainly) revolutionary, however ambiguous it may have come to seem since then. Stendhal seemed to think upward mobility could mainly be aligned <i>against</i> money-making. The novel&#x2019;s early chapters find various ways, subtle and not so subtle, of associating Julien with those still poorer and more unfortunate than himself, like the prisoners on the other side of M. Valenod&#x2019;s wall, who are stopped from singing so as not to disturb Valenod&#x2019;s distinguished guests as they carouse. Even the scene in which M. de R�nal decides to hire Julien as his children&#x2019;s tutor, thereby setting the novel&#x2019;s plot in motion, is framed by concern&#x2014;not M. de R�nal&#x2019;s, of course, but the novel&#x2019;s&#x2014;over how the poor of the village are being treated by its constituted authorities. As he climbs his various ladders, Julien somehow carries this concern with him. One of the novel&#x2019;s ongoing interpretive mysteries is what exactly he is striving for or, more precisely, to what extent his goals transcend the acquisition of money and power for himself. </p></p><h2>Spirit Country: Contemporary Australian Aboriginal Art</h2><p>Indigenous artists have brought their culture to the international stage from the breadth of the Australian continent and its surrounding islands. <i>Spirit Country</i> explores the vibrant contemporary Aboriginal art that has caught the eyes of the western art world. However, for those who&nbsp;create them, they are also religious documents, maps, personal histories, and title deeds to land. Through their work, Aboriginal artists invite a more appreciative understanding of their world and its diversity. The book celebrates the emergence of a modern and vibrant indigenous voice though the visual arts.</p><p><b>Jennifer Isaacs</b> is a prominent writer, curator, and arts manager widely recognized for her many bestselling books on Aboriginal culture, including&nbsp;<i>Australian Aboriginal Paintings </i>and&nbsp;<i>Australian Dreaming: 40,000 Years of Aboriginal History</i>.<br></p><h2>High Cotton: Selected Stories of Joe R. Lansdale</h2><p>This collection of Joe R. Lansdale stories represents the best of the &#x201c;Lansdale&#x201d; genre&#x2014;a strange mixture of dark crime, even darker humor, and adventure tales. The stories are varied in setting and theme, but they are all pure Lansdale&#x2014;eerie, amusing, and occasionally horrific. In &#x201c;The Pit,&#x201d; modern gladiators square off against one another using Roman methods. An alternate-history tale called &#x201c;Trains Not Taken&#x201d; shows Buffalo Bill as an ambassador and Wild Bill Hickok as a clerk. Lansdale&#x2019;s love of large lizards and humor are evident in the stories &#x201c;Godzilla&#x2019;s Twelve Step Program&#x201d; and &#x201c;Bob the Dinosaur Goes to Disneyland.&#x201d;<br></p><p>Like Stephen King, Joe R. Lansdale is a powerful and versatile author. He writes frequently funny, often disturbing suspense, horror, dark fantasy, science fiction, and Western fiction. And like King, he has a strong sense of place: he successfully invokes the spirit of the West and demonstrates a wonderful and distinctly Texan gift for a phrase. But don't be fooled--the resemblances are superficial. Joe R. Lansdale writes like nobody but his own self. And, unjustly, he's not yet a bestselling author.<p> The genre-jumping collection <i>High Cotton</i> is subtitled <i>Selected Stories of Joe R. Lansdale</i>, but could more rightly be called <i>The Best of Joe R. Lansdale</i>. If you haven't read Lansdale, this is the place to start. If you like Lansdale, you already know you want this collection, even if you already own <i>By Bizarre Hands</i>, which contains 7 of these 21 stories. If, however, you are of a delicate constitution or a sensitive nature, you might want to steer clear. Lansdale can be blunt, or gross, or grim, sometimes all at once.</p><p> Most of the stories in <i>High Cotton</i> are excellent, and some are already classics. "Night They Missed the Horror Show," a tale of bored young hell-raisers who discover dreadful new depths of trouble, is one of the great horror stories of the 20th century. The alternate-history Western "Letter from the South, Two Moons West of Nacogdoches" packs a lot of big (and shocking) changes into four pages. In the crime story "The Steel Valentine," a fading athlete finds himself the captive of his lover's merciless, criminal husband. In "The Phone Woman," a man discovers his horrifying true nature in a violent act. And in the screwball "Mister Weed-Eater," a man's life is turned upside-down and inside-out by his innocent attempt to help a blind groundskeeper.</p><p> Joe R. Lansdale is the author of over 20 books, including the Hap Collins and Leonard Pine mystery series. He has won the American Mystery Award, the <i>Booklist</i> Editor's Award, five Bram Stoker Awards, the British Fantasy Award, and the International Crime Writers Award. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p><b>Joe R.

Despite the lack of evidence, Bony suspects murder--which leads him to uncover some strange goings-on.</p><p>For readers who thought they'd exhausted the list of Golden Age mystery writers, Australian author Arthur Upfield (1888-1964) is often a pleasant surprise. The tales of Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte (or Bony, as he is known) offer all of the major pleasures of Christie, Tey, and Doyle; but Upfield's works also carry the freshness of his island continent setting and of his "half-caste" hero. Bony, born of an aborigine mother and a white father, is a genius of criminal science and also a classic gentleman. Suave and always impeccably dressed (except, of course, when in disguise), he solves mysteries through patience. As he often repeats to John Muir--one of the many young men he tutors: "Never race Time. Make Time an ally, for Time is the greatest detective that ever was or ever will be." Through Bony, Upfield's progressive series frequently explores the foundations of Australian race prejudices and defies them with Bonaparte's genial wit and disarming smile.<p> In <i>Murder Down Under</i> the detective is on holiday in western Australia but inevitably winds up with a working vacation, this time assisting young Sergeant Muir. Farmer George Loftus has disappeared, and his car was found smashed along the world's longest fence in the wheat town of Burracoppin. The days before Loftus's disappearance are filled with clues that point to Leonard Wallace, owner of the Burracoppin Hotel. Loftus had given Wallace a ride from Perth back to the hotel, and the pair had shared drinks in the bar before driving off together at 1 a.m.--shortly before the disappearance. Wallace claims that the two had argued and that he had left the car well before the accident. Now, Bony must parse truth and fiction in his inimitable style. Along the way, however, he meets the bizarre Mr. Jelly, an amateur criminologist who collects portraits of murders and who may have some insights into the case. <i>Murder Down Under</i> is a true classic: a rich world of quirky characters and fascinating scenery built around a complex and satisfying puzzle.

His previous adult novels include <i>Sati, The Season of Passage,</i> and <i>The Cold One</i>. Pike lives in Santa Barbara, California.<br>YA-- A story of the Second Coming. Sati, a blond, blue-eyed beauty, declares simply that she is God and has come to "play a while." Her story is told by a skeptical truck driver, Michael, who picks up the newly reborn goddess along a desert highway and takes her to his apartment and into his circle of friends. Although God appears as Mother rather than Father in this carefully and sparingly written fantasy, the language and viewpoint are uncomplicatedly masculine. Pike explicates all sophisticated allusions in context, making the book clearly suitable for YAs. Readers should be comfortable with the narrator's voice and psyche, as Michael struggles with his doubts and desire to believe. Sati could be a valuable addition to a growing library of multicultural literature for high school students. Although its characters are not from minorities, it will make a fine introduction to non-Christian religious beliefs, for Sati's philosophy and persona is based on a mixture of Buddhist, Hindu, and other spiritual thought. The essence of her thesis is that "We're all God."-- Marya Andreen, R. E.

He died in February 2010.*Starred Review* In the steeplechase world, &#x201c;refusal&#x201d; means that a horse will not take a jump. Dick Francis&#x2019; son Felix, collaborator with his father on several novels and now the heir to his father&#x2019;s line of mysteries, extends the equestrian definition to the massively banged-up (physically and emotionally) Sid Halley, who stars in a Francis novel for the first time since 2006. Halley, a champion steeplechase jockey who lost his left hand to the double whammy of a fall from a horse and an attack by a thug, long ago turned his insider&#x2019;s knowledge of the race world into private investigative work. But an intense fear campaign directed at his girlfriend made him retire from the track altogether at the end of Under Orders. When the chairman of the British Racing Authority asks Halley to investigate his strong suspicion that races are being fixed, Halley refuses. Even after the chairman is found dead, threats made to Halley&#x2019;s family, and his daughter placed in danger, Halley still refuses, holding onto the safety of his family, which he knows would be blown apart by his investigating the case. What finally tips Halley into changing his mind is entirely convincing, even though it ratchets up the danger for Halley and his family. This is fascinating reading on every level, from the neatly calibrated plot, moving from suspense to terror, to all the details of the racing world Francis provides. Halley is now, as before, an utterly complex, interest-holding character. And the final, moral turn that Francis makes of &#x201c;refusal&#x201d; is brilliant. A heroic return for Sid Halley. --Connie Fletcher</p><h2>Abundant Beauty: The Adventurous Travels of Marianne North, Botanical Artist</h2><p>In 1871, Marianne North, a brilliant artist with a keen interest in botany, set-forth to travel the world on a quest to paint indigenous plants in their natural habitat. Encouraged by her friend Charles Darwin, North travelled by boat, train, mule, foot and palanquin to every continent except Antarctica. She circled the globe twice over fifteen years and accumulated an extensive and valuable collection of more than eight hundred paintings, which today comprise the esteemed Marianne North Gallery at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, London.<br><br>North&#x2014;high-spirited, indefatigable, and brave&#x2014;also kept detailed journals, which were posthumously published in three volumes in the late 1800s. Abundant Beauty collects the most engaging writings from those journals in one edition, including rich descriptions of botanica and delightful accounts of local people and customs from her sometimes dangerous travels. Abundant Beauty is a fascinating and informative read for botanists, gardeners, historians, and armchair travellers.</p><p><b>Marianne North</b> was born in 1830 in Hastings, England. The daughter of a politician, North was raised in a socially active and intellectually stimulating household. She cared for her parents until their deaths, taking on the role of her father&#x2019;s housekeeper and travelling companion until he died in 1869. For the next fifteen years, she travelled extensively, painting indigenous and unique plants from the four corners of the globe. She took her last journey (to Chile) in 1884 and then, suffering from attacks of nerves,&#x201d; settled for good at her cottage at Gloucestershire to organize her journals. A number of plant species are named in her honour, including <i>Areca northiana</i>, <i>Crinum northianum</i>, and <i>Kniphofia northiana</i>. Marianne North died in 1890.<br><br><b>Laura Ponsonby</b>, former Archivist, Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, is the author of two books about Marianne North.<br>from "Brazil"<br><br>Two more miles at full gallop down hill took us to Petropolis, and I was soon in Mr. Miles&#x2019;s comfortable hotel, and again among friends, with whom I had a merry English dinner. Then came two days of rain and cold and loneliness, in which I worked and walked and soaked and froze, and came to the conclusion Petropolis was an odious place, a bad imitation of a second-class German watering-place, with its red roofs, little toy houses, and big palace in the midst, the river cut and straightened into a ditch, running down the middle of the principal street, with fanciful wooden bridges crossing it continually, and its banks planted with formal trees; though, when one came to think and thaw a bit, those very trees were in themselves a sight to see: umbrella-trees with their large heart-shaped leaves and pink fluffy flowers, and <i>araucarias</i> larger than any in England. My friend Mr. Hinchcliff had written me minute directions how to find one of his favorite walks, where he promised I should see ideal tropical tangles. I paddled through the mud and rain to find, alas! nothing but charcoal and ashes remained; some German women added insult to injury by informing me it was verboten to go further that way, so I returned to my packing in disgust.<br><br>I was glad to see the Gordons arrive, and to hear them say they had taken their and my places in the coach for Juiz de Fora the next morning. Mrs. Miles took charge of my tin box and sketching umbrella, which, I may as well say here, is a perfectly useless article in the tropics; when the real unclouded sun is shining one requires a more solid shade than that of a gingham umbrella, and it is far too heavy to drag about in a hot climate, so I was glad to be quit of it.<br><br>It rained all night, and was still raining when we packed ourselves into the coach at six on the morning of the 28th of October, and four splendid mules, after their usual resistance, started suddenly at full gallop with the swinging, rattling old vehicle Such scenery! High trees draped with bougainvillea to the very tops, bushes of the same nearer the ground reminding one of the great rhododendrons in our own shrubberies in May at home, and of much the same colour, though occasionally paler and pinker. There were orange-flowered cassia-trees (whose leaves fold close together at night like the sensitive plant) and scarlet erythrinas looking like gems among the masses of rich green; exquisite peeps of the river, winding below its woody banks or rushing among great stones and rocks, came upon us, and were gone again with tantalising rapidity.<br><br>My friends only laughed when I grumbled at the mules going so fast; now and then a peaked mountain-top pierced its way through the clouds for a moment and was lost again, then came a gray overhanging cliff sprinkled with bracket-like wild pines spiked with greenish flowers; the near banks were hidden by masses of large-leaved ferns and begonias and arums of many sorts, whose young fresh leaves and fronds were often tinted with crimson or copper-colour. The wild agaves too were very odd: having had their poor centre shoots twisted out, the sap accumulated in the hollow, and a wine or spirit was made from it; the wretched wounded things, sending up dwarfish flowers and prickly shoots from their other joints, formed a strange disagreeable looking bush, several of which made a most efficient hedge. Under each of these flowers a bulb formed, which when ripe dropped and rooted itself, thus replacing the parent whose life ended at its birth. Another curious plant here abounded, the marica, like a lovely blue iris, which flowers and shoots from the ends of the leaves of the old plant, the leaf being often more than a yard in length, and weighed down to the ground by the bunch at its end. When the flower is over, a bulb forms under it which produces roots; eventually the connecting leaf rots off, so that a perfect circle of young plants succeeds round the original old one. When in flower the appearance was very peculiar; a perfect rosette of bent green leaves and a circle of delicate blue flowers outside them.<br></p><h2>The Master of Heathcrest Hall (The Magicians and Mrs. Quent)</h2><p>Even as her husband is about to attain undreamed-of power, Ivy Quent fears for her family&#x2019;s safety.

In years past, they would dwell here during the darkest winter months, when the thick stone offered protection from the winds that swept out of the north&#x2014;�and from the wolves that prowled the frozen land, their fur ragged, desperate enough to brave fire and arrow in search of something to fill their shrunken bellies.<br><br>For most of the year, the people lived five days&#x2019; walk to the south of this place, in a camp by the blue sea. There they would spend the long days as they had for time out of mind, prying mussels from the rocks and spearing fish and cormorants, until they became as sleek as the otters that basked on the shore in the sun.<br><br>At least, that was how things used to be. Layka still remembered what it had been like when she was smaller. She would spend the warm evenings walking along the beach, clad only in a supple doeskin, choosing shells that might be strung on a piece of leather&#x2014;�saving them for the day when she was old enough to begin making herself beautiful for the young men who visited on occasion from the other camps down the shore.<br><br>But that was before everything changed.<br><br>It began one day with a violent shuddering of the ground. An awful groaning noise filled the air, and the sea pulled away from the shore. All knew this was a sign to flee to a higher place, but even as they did so a sudden night fell over the world. It was as if a fist had closed around the burning ember of the sun, snuffing it out. The people looked up and, for the first time, saw an unfamiliar red spark smoldering among the stars. What this new object in the night sky was, no one knew&#x2014;�not even Nesharu, who of all the people was the oldest and wisest.<br><br>At last the trembling of the ground ceased, and the ocean roared back upon the beach. Dawn came, and the day seemed to pass as usual. But when it ended, the red spark again shone in the sky, a little brighter than before. The night that followed lasted too long. The world grew cold, and though it was yet early summer, stars that should only have risen in autumn spun into the sky. By morning, when Layka walked along the shore, she found it rimed with frost. She shivered despite the aurochs hide she had thrown over her shoulders, and had to use her nails to pry up shells from the sand.<br><br>After that, the days no longer continued their gradual and steady lengthening toward midsummer. Instead, one night might flit by, swift as a bat, followed by a day during which the sun seemed to hang motionless overhead, blazing so fiercely that the otters were forced to slip into the sea to escape its heat. Then, without warning, the heat would give way to bitter cold after the sun failed to show itself for what felt like days.<br><br>A fear came over the people. Plants wilted and shriveled in alternation. Animals grew torpid and confused, wandering across the land as if they did not know which direction to go. Many dead fish washed up on the shore, carried by currents that had gone too hot or cold to sustain them. Sometimes other things washed up on the beach as well: gelatinous remnants of unknown creatures that smelled so foul even the dogs would not touch them. And all the while the red spark grew larger in the sky, glaring like the eye of some angry beast.<br><br>That had been three years ago. Or at least so they guessed, for they could no longer count the years by the passage of the seasons. Winter no longer gave way to spring; bright summer never dulled to autumn. Instead, the sequence of days was as patternless as a handful of fish bones thrown on the midden heap. Yet it must have been three years since everything changed, or close to it, for Layka had been just past her thirteenth winter then, and now she was nearly a woman.<br><br>Not that it mattered. Young men never came from the other camps anymore. Nobody did, not since the red eye had shown itself. The pretty shells Layka had gathered remained unstrung, piled in a corner of the hut she shared with her parents and her brother. Anyway, there was no time to think about making herself beautiful. It was all she and the others could do to survive. Those first months had been especially awful. Game perished. Springs and rivulets went dry, and the sea grew barren of fish. The people froze and sweltered in alternation, and many succumbed to hunger or fever.<br><br>That any of them managed to live was due to Nesharu. For hours she would stand watching the sky, observing the movements of birds or listening to the wind. Then she would tell the people where to look for water or animals to hunt. At first they found little to sustain them. Yet over time some plants began to sprout again, spindly but green. A few animals returned, as did the fish in the sea. And though these were not nearly so plentiful as before, they were enough. The days and nights came and went, sometimes short, sometimes long. For three years the people struggled and endured.<br><br>Then a young man came to the camp.<br><br>It was one of those endless afternoons when the sunlight went flat and turned everything to white. The people looked up to see a hunter they did not know just beyond the huts. At once the men rushed toward him, spears at the ready, but it was soon obvious that he posed no threat. He was thin, his beard crusted with salt, and despite the heat of the day he was shivering. The people gathered around him and saw that the man bore deep gashes on his arm and side. The flesh around the wounds had turned the color of ash and gave off a rank odor.<br><br>The hunter fell to the ground and started to mutter, but it was difficult to understand him. By the ochre that stained the hides he wore, he came from one of the camps around the great curve in the shoreline many days&#x2019; walk to the south, and the language spoken there was not entirely like that of the people. However, they gave him water, and after a time Nesharu made out some of his speech.<br><br>They came during a long night, the hunter told them. Shadows that stalked, shadows with pointed teeth. They ate men from the inside out and put on their skins, so you could not tell what they were. Then, when darkness fell, they cast off the skins to feed, and no arrow could pierce them.<br><br>The people were frightened by these words. Layka looked at his wounds, counting the parallel lines in his flesh, and wondered what kind of animal had seven talons upon each of its paws.<br><br>&#x201c;If an arrow will not pierce them, how can these shadows be hunted?&#x201d; Nesharu asked as she knelt beside the man, a listless wind stirring her hair like the white tendrils of an anemone in the shallows.<br><br>&#x201c;Take their heads,&#x201d; the hunter croaked through cracked lips. &#x201c;While they still wear a man&#x2019;s skin, take their heads.&#x201d;<br><br>Nesharu sat with the hunter for many more hours, her weathered face grim as she leaned close, trying to make out more of the man&#x2019;s words. But the hunter&#x2019;s voice grew fainter, until his lips moved without making any sound, and his eyes stared blindly. Then, as the sun at last dipped below the edge of the sea, his spirit left him.<br><br>The people gathered wood, and upon Nesharu&#x2019;s direction they burned the body far away from the huts as the red eye looked down from above. It was a circle nearly as large as the moon now, its light staining the ground like blood after a hunt.<br><br>That night was short, but by the time a swift dawn swept across the land, three men were already heading out from the camp. They were the fastest runners among the people. Since the red eye appeared in the sky, no one had gone more than a long day&#x2019;s walk away from the camp. Now the men intended to go all the way around the great bend of the shore, to the southern camps, to see if they could learn more about the things the hunter had spoken of&#x2014;�and what danger they might pose to the people. The runners quickly became small specks on the horizon, then were lost from view.<br><br>For five alternations of light and dark, the people waited. Then, just as the sun heaved into the sky at the start of the sixth day, a single runner stumbled into the camp. It was Layka&#x2019;s brother, Tennek.<br><br>&#x201c;You are a good runner,&#x201d; Nesharu said as the people gathered around Tennek, &#x201c;but it is still much too soon for you to have gone all the way past the great bend and back. And where are the others?&#x201d;<br><br>Tennek shook his head, unable to speak. His breaths came rapidly, and his eyes were wide, as if one of the long-�fanged cats pursued him. Layka came forward bearing a shell filled with water and gave it to her elder brother. He drank it, and at last his breathing eased so that he could speak.<br><br>The others gathered close. Despite the rising sun, a coldness crept over them as Tennek described how, on the second day out, the runners came to a camp along the shore just where it began to bend to the east.<br><br>Who dwelled there, they did not know, for the small lodges made of sticks and mud were all empty. There was wood in the fire pits and a rack of drying fish, as well as a large chunk of flint set out on a flat stone, ready to be struck and knapped into points. It looked as if the people who had made this camp planned to return at any moment.<br><br>By then a sudden twilight was descending, and as there was no other shelter, the three runners retreated into one of the empty lodges. They took turns keeping watch, only at some point during the night Tennek and Haleth both woke to discover that Davu was gone. They called out to him from the entrance of the lodge, but there was no answer. When dawn broke, they went out to look for him.<br><br>They spent the whole day searching, but there was no sign of Davu in the camp or anywhere around it. Still they kept looking until night fell, when again they had no choice but to retreat into one of the lodges in the camp. This time, neither of them slept, and when morning at last came they agreed they must continue their journey south and hope that Davu would either find them or return to the people. They took some of the dried fish and the flint core, then left the camp.<br><br>As they did, they saw Davu walking toward them along the shore. Surprised and happy, they hurried to him and asked him where he had been.<br><br>He did not answer. His eyes were hard and dull as pebbles, and there were strange marks on his hand, like a tattoo made with charcoal and a bone needle, only sharper and darker. Haleth asked Davu to hold out his hand so he might look at the tattoo more closely. Davu did not respond, so Haleth reached out to take his hand.<br><br>And Davu lunged forward to clamp his teeth upon Haleth&#x2019;s throat.<br><br>So astonished were both Tennek and Haleth that for a moment neither of them moved. Only then came a great gush of blood, and Haleth cried out. He pulled away from Davu&#x2019;s grasp, his hands fluttering to his neck, but they could not stanch the flow. As Tennek watched, Haleth sank to his knees, then collapsed into the sand.<br><br>Tennek tried to run, but his feet would not move, and then Davu was before him, his eyes as dark and empty as a shark&#x2019;s, his mouth wet with red. He reached out a hand, the one marked with black lines, and wrapped its fingers around Tennek&#x2019;s throat.<br><br>Pain at last freed Tennek from his torpor. He tightened his grip around the flint core in his hand, then swung his arm around and brought the heavy chunk of stone crashing against the side of Davu&#x2019;s face. There was a crunching noise as Davu&#x2019;s head turned halfway around on his shoulders.<br><br>Yet despite this, Davu&#x2019;s hands continued to grope blindly. Tennek shoved him backward, so that he fell to the sand, then knelt and brought the sharp end of the flint core down upon Davu&#x2019;s spine, again and again, until at last it was done and Davu&#x2019;s head rolled free. No blood came from the stump of his neck, and Tennek did not see muscle or tendon or bone. There was only a gray substance, thick as sea kelp, oozing from both body and head. For a minute Tennek stared at the two corpses on the beach.<br><br>Then he threw down the flint and ran, hardly stopping for breath or water, until he returned to the camp.<br><br>Many of the people cried out as Tennek finished describing what had befallen him, but Layka could think only that her brother was weary, and that he needed more water. Before she could bring it to him, Nesharu took up a small flint knife and flicked it against Tennek&#x2019;s arm. Tennek let out a cry. All gazed expectantly at the cut on his arm.<br><br>A stream of bright red welled forth.<br><br>Nesharu nodded, then let Layka bring another shell of water to her brother.<br><br>&#x201c;It is no longer safe here,&#x201d; Nesharu said then. &#x201c;We must leave this place. We will make for our winter-�home.&#x201d; And before the sun had reached its highest point, the people were marching away from the shore, their few belongings on their backs.<br><br>That had been seven sunrises ago. It had taken them longer to reach the cave than they expected, for a number of the days passed swiftly, while one of the nights went on so long that snow began to drift down before the sun rose again. Several times they saw plumes of smoke rising in the distance, and they gave these a wide berth. And once, as they huddled together in darkness, they heard distant screams borne on the night wind&#x2014;�though whether they were the sounds of humans or some animal, they could not be certain.<br><br>Their trek was nearing its end when they encountered a band much like their own: a collection of some thirty women, children, infants, and men. By their shell necklaces and wristbands, and by their speech, they were from one of the other camps along the western shore. This was one of the bands that the people sometimes traded with, and from whose young men Layka might possibly choose a mate.<br><br>On this occasion their meeting was not so friendly as it would have been for trading goods or seeking partners in years past, and the two bands approached one another slowly, spears at the ready. However, their wise one was with them: a woman who, like Nesharu, had seen at least forty winters. She and Nesharu came together and spoke for a time, their heads bowed together. Then the other band turned and continued northward.<br><br>Nesharu said the others knew of the shadows. The band had come upon a camp that had been empty save for scraps of skin. Their own band had been attacked two nights before, and they had lost four to swirls of darkness that lunged and bit, dragging them into the night.<br><br>&#x201c;Where do they go now?&#x201d; Tennek asked, looking after the others.<br><br>&#x201c;They go to find shelter, as we do,&#x201d; Nesharu said, taking up her walking stick. &#x201c;Come, Layka, walk with me for a while. There are plants here that do not grow by the shore that I want to show you.&#x201d;<br><br>Layka hurried after the older woman. She always liked it when Nesharu singled her out. The older woman would tell her what things were good to eat, and which would make a man go numb and stop his heart, and whether the patterns of kelp and shells on the shore meant there would be good fishing or a storm was coming.<br><br>Usually Layka was quick to remember these sorts of things. Only now she seemed to forget the names of the plants as soon as Nesharu told them to her. She kept thinking of the band of people marching to the north, seeking shelter. Only what place could provide shelter from the dark? When night fell, did not even the brightest of fires cast shadows? Layka wanted to ask Nesharu these things, but instead she chewed a piece of dried fish as she walked and listened to the older woman speak.<b>Praise for Galen Beckett&#x2019;s acclaimed series:</b><br><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&#x201c;A charming and accomplished debut, sure to delight fantasy aficionados and lovers of gothic romances alike.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jacqueline Carey, author of <i>Naamah&#x2019;s Curse,</i> on <i>The Magicians and Mrs. Quent</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>&#x201c;A novel of manners, wit, great characters and immersion in a world that is lovingly described . . . one of those novels that stay with you for a long time.&#x201d;&#x2014;Fantasy Book Critic, on <i>The House on Durrow Street</i><br><br>&#x201c;A splendid fantasy that is both magical and very proper.&#x201d;&#x2014;SFRevu, on<i>&nbsp;The House on Durrow Street</i>.</p><h2>The Founding Finaglers</h2><p>The Founding Finaglers</p><p></p><h2>Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life</h2><p><p>Divorce rocks the very foundation of our beings, leaving us feeling lonely, flawed, enraged, undesirable, hopeless, and empty. In <em>Spiritual Divorce,</em> bestselling author and workshop leader Debbie Ford reveals how this devastation can be transformed into a profoundly enlightening experience. This empowering guide shows how the collapse of a marriage is, at root, a spiritual wake-up call, an opportunity to liberate ourselves and reclaim our lives. The end of a relationship -- no matter who ends it -- is a damaging moment.

Learn to use your divorce -- don't let it use you! <em>Spiritual Divorce</em> can help you reclaim your personal power, your joy, and the freedom to create the life of your dreams.</p></p><p>Whether you are the one who leaves or the one who is left, divorce is a painful, wrenching experience, explains author Debbie Ford. Since Ford is comfortable dwelling in the shadow side of life, it's not surprising that she believes that the excruciating pain of divorce can lead to enormous spiritual growth. "Emotional turmoil can be a powerful catalyst to reconnect us with our divine nature," she writes. "It propels us into a journey of self discovery and urges us to learn how to love and accept our entire being." Herein lies the promise of a "spiritual divorce." <p> Because Ford is a highly effective workshop leader, she has a knack for breaking down spiritual matters into manageable bites. She is also willing to share the truth of her own painful divorce, allowing readers to see her initial pain and consuming resentments. Ford divides her book into seven laws, beginning with the "The Law of Acceptance," where readers are asked to imagine a benevolent divine order at play rather than taking a blaming stance. In the section titled "The Law of Responsibility," Ford encourages readers to gently begin the process of taking responsibility for their own darkest qualities. This is the thrust of Ford's highly respected shadow work--illuminating the dark side so we can stand in divine light. Each section ends with "Healing Action Steps," where Ford suggests specific exercises or meditations. For example, in the final chapter Ford asks readers to make a new "divorce vow" that is a lifelong commitment to one's highest self. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><p><strong>DEBBIE FORD</strong> (October 1, 1955 - February 17, 2013) is the national bestselling author of <em>Dark Side of the Light Chasers, Secret of the Shadow, Spiritual Divorce, The Right Questions, The Best Year of Your Life, Why Good People Do Bad Things</em>, and <em>The 21-Day Consciousness Cleanse</em>.</p></p><h2>The Book of Azariah</h2><p>Used.

Their landing was significant not only for the outcome of World War II, but also for the conduct of war ever since, for the invasion of Guadalcanal marked the first time that a combined air, sea, and land assault had ever been attempted. It is for that reason that tacticians and military historians study the months-long battle today, and their primary guide to that conflict is Richard Tregaskis's extraordinary <i>Guadalcanal Diary</i>.<p> A volunteer combat correspondent, Tregaskis braved much danger to bring the story of the fighting to American readers. But he was not one to celebrate his own exploits, and in the pages of his book, he centers on the brave young men from all over the United States who fought and died in appalling numbers. His attention to detail yields arresting descriptions of attacks and counterattacks, of moments of low morale and of exaltation, of moments of quiet behind the lines and of sheer terror at the very point of engagement. Tregaskis's style is unadorned and matter-of-fact, and his present-tense narrative places the reader in the thick of the battle during those "hopeless weeks."</p><p> The direct literary ancestor of books of military reportage such as Mark Bowden's <i>Black Hawk Down</i> and Michael Herr's <i>Dispatches</i>, <i>Guadalcanal Diary</i> is an exemplary work of journalism, and as vivid a portrait of men under fire as has ever been committed to print. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>history&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S.A. $14.95<br>Canada $22.50<br>This celebrated classic gives a soldier's-eye-view of the Guadalcanal battles--crucial to World War II, the war that continues to fascinate us all, and to military history in general. Unlike some of those on Guadalcanal in the fall of 1942, Richard Tregaskis volunteered to be there. An on-location news correspondent (at the time, one of only two on Guadalcanal), he lived alongside the soldiers: sleeping on the ground--only to be awoken by air raids--eating the sometimes meager rations, and braving some of the most dangerous battlefields of World War II. He more than once narrowly escaped the enemy's fire, and so we have this incisive and exciting inside account of the groundbreaking initial landing of U.S. troops on Guadalcanal. <br><br>With a new Introduction by Mark Bowden--renowned journalist and author of Black Hawk Down--this edition of Guadalcanal Diary makes available once more one of the most important American works of the war.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Armchair Reader: Civil War, Untold Stories of the Blue and Gray</h2><p><p><em>Civil War, Untold Tales of the Blue and Gray</em>, from the popular Armchair Reader series, has plenty to offer readers who are fascinated by the politics, military strategies, and human tragedies of the War Between the States.

Adams made the universe a much funnier place to inhabit and forever changed the way we think about towels, extraterrestrial poetry, and especially the number 42. And then, too soon, he was gone.<br><br>Just who was this impossibly tall Englishman who wedded science fiction and absurdist humor to create the multimillion-selling five-book &#x201c;trilogy&#x201d; that became a cult phenomenon read round the world? Even if you&#x2019;ve dined in the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, you&#x2019;ve been exposed to only a portion of the offbeat, endearing, and irresistible Adams mystique. Have you met the only official unofficial member of Monty Python&#x2019;s Flying Circus? The very first person to purchase a Macintosh computer? The first (and thus far only) author to play a guitar solo onstage with Pink Floyd? Adams was also the writer so notorious for missing deadlines that he had to be held captive in a hotel room under the watchful eye of his editor; the creator of the epic computer game Starship Titanic<i>;</i> and a globetrotting wildlife crusader.<br><br>A longtime friend of the author, Nick Webb reveals many quirks and contradictions: Adams as the high-tech-gadget junkie and lavish gift giver . . .irrepressible ham and painfully timid soul . . . gregarious conversationalist and brooding depressive . . . brilliant intellect and prickly egotist. Into the brief span of forty-nine years, Douglas Adams exuberantly crammed more lives than the most resilient cat&#x2013;while still finding time and energy to pursue whatever side projects captivated his ever-inquisitive mind. <br><br>By turns touching, tongue-in-cheek, and not at all timid about telling the warts-and-all truth, Wish You Were Here is summation as celebration&#x2013; a look back at a life well worth the vicarious reliving, and studded with anecdote, droll comic incident, and heartfelt insight as its subject&#x2019;s own unforgettable tales of cosmic wanderlust. For the countless fans of Douglas Adams and his unique and winsome world, here is a wonderful postcard: to be read, reread, and treasured for the memories it bears.</p><p>NICK WEBB<b> </b>was a publisher for nearly thirty years before, perversely, turning to writing. He commissioned The Hitchhiker&#x2019;s Guide to the Galaxy while he was an editor at Pan Books, and remained good friends with Douglas Adams until the end of the author's life. He lives in Hackney.Webb was the editor at Britain's Pan Books who bought the book rights to Adams's <i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy </i>in 1978, back when it was a hit radio show on the BBC. While Webb didn't have much to do with Adams professionally after that, the two remained friendly until Adams's death, at age 49, in 2001, and that closeness pervades this authorized biography and its conversational tone. That doesn't mean the story is sugarcoated; Adams is occasionally chided for his emotional thickness, and Webb deals frankly with the consequences of his chronic slowness as a writer (one <i>Hitchhiker </i>novel was produced only when his editor, Sonny Mehta, booked a hotel room and sat with him as he turned out the pages). Another section addresses the thorny issue of who contributed what to the zany plot line of the radio series and how Adams's collaborator, John Lloyd, was nudged out of the book deal. For the most part, however, Webb genially celebrates Adams's comic talent and zest for life, aiming his account squarely at the large <i>Hitchhiker </i>fan base with occasional overtures to readers who don't necessarily know every nuance of the trilogy. It might be overstating matters to suggest that "before Douglas nobody had been <i>cosmically </i>funny," but Webb's tribute makes it easy to see why those who knew Adams admired him so greatly. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Jack Nicklaus thinks enough of him to have opened the Nicklaus/Flick Golf School, with teaching facilities in Salt Lake City, Palm Beach, Pebble Beach, Scottsdale, and Harbor Springs (MI). The following golfers -- pro and amateur -- all extol his virtues from tee to green: Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, Paul Azinger, Phil Mickelson, Judy Rankin, Charles Barkley, Byron Nelson, and Chi Chi Rodriguez. Now, Flick has written a book that's inspirational, instructional and entertaining -- and will take five to ten strokes off even the most casual hacker's game.<br><br><b>On Golf</b> uniquely captures Jim Flick's method of motivational, one-on-one teaching, which emphasizes his belief that one should play golf, not work it. Whether you shoot 100 and are aiming for 90, or shoot 80 and are aiming for 70, <b>On Golf</b> is the best possible way to make sure that when you play a round of golf, your good walk will never be spoiled.</p><p>Jim Flick shares top billing with Jack Nicklaus on a string of highly popular golf schools, so his pedigree is unquestionable. His approach to the game is "Let's <i>play</i> golf, not work it." His 15 lessons take in the necessary technique, but Flick's great strength is in the way he helps golfers think their way through the game. Attitude is key in his cosmology: "The attitude you bring to the game," he emphasizes, "will ultimately determine the level of proficiency you attain in it."Jim Flick, director of training and education for the Nicklaus/Flick Golf School, is one of America's most celebrated golf instructors.

Readers will wonder how the hypothetical descendants will react to these stories about Brigitte Bardot, Catherine Deneuve, Jane Fonda and other women. Vadim was a promising newcomer to films when he met Bardot, 15, and persuaded her parents to let her appear in his movie. She needed no urging to allow him to introduce her to sex, he writes. Anecdotes about their reckless lovemaking abound, leading up to her 18th birthday, when Bardot's father consented to their wedding.

At first it was simple line drawings. They developed about 2,000 characters, all pictures of objects. After about 2,000 years the written language, now known as cuneiform, had developed into wedge-shaped symbols, dashes put together in different configurations. Each of these geometric characters represented an idea or often just a sound. Mesopotamian society revered the elite few who could write and read these texts, which were written on clay tablets. If these scribes were revered, birds were sacred animals because their feet left messages in clay that resembled cuneiform but were another language, one even the scribes could not read. Perhaps the messages were intended only for other birds.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Far up in the northern regions of New York City, in a place known as the Bronx, in what was called a zoo, was a huge birdcage made of metal, wrought and twisted and crafted to perfection. In the cage lived some of the most beautiful birds in the world, including a bright green quetzal from Guatemala. The quetzal didn&#x2019;t know that he was originally from Guatemala, just like he didn&#x2019;t know that he now lived in the Bronx. Nor did he understand the idea of a zoo. But he may have suspected that he was beautiful.</p><p>For most of his life he had lived in this tall cage with laurel branches to perch on and all the avocado he could eat. There were also other birds from different places or maybe the same place. He didn&#x2019;t really know. This quetzal had been in the Bronx for so long that he no longer remembered the green highlands of his birth, and he was not unhappy where he was.</p><p>He was a quiet bird who kept to himself, often spending hours on a branch without moving until everyone forgot he was there. But he had a friendly look, his close-cropped fuzzy green plumes setting off his little round head. Hairless monkeys, some with hair on the tops of their heads, came to the cage to see the birds and they always liked the quetzal when they could spot him. He tried not to be spotted and they never harmed him.</p><p>Late at night there were screams of faraway monkeys&#x2014;loud, shrill notes held for long seconds. But it was in the distance and not very troubling. The quetzal had a vague notion that nights were much noisier in his native land. He liked the quiet night in the Bronx. But now he was hearing an odd creak. He heard it again. He looked up at the bolted metal struts of the cage, the only sky he could remember, and suddenly the cage began to fall in. Birds screeched and squawked and chirped the news: the aviary was collapsing.</p><p>Metal was crashing to the ground louder than monkey screams, and feathers seemed to be everywhere. The quetzal had only one thought&#x2014;he had to get in the air where it was safe. So he spread his green wings and showed the golden tips and unfurled his two-foot tail that was almost twice the length of his glowing green body.</p><p>It is difficult not to notice a quetzal in flight, which is why they prefer not to move too much. They fly with a long, undulating green feather tail, and the fine scarlet under feathers of the body show from below. The ancient peoples of Central America, the Mayans and the Aztecs, believed the quetzal was a god. They called it a winged snake. Even today its official name is the Resplendent Quetzal.</p><p>But now everyone was too busy to notice the resplendentness of the quetzal&#x2019;s flight. Some of the birds went to the bottom of the cage, where there were huts and branches to hide under, and others took refuge in the nearby trees. But the Resplendent Quetzal took off for the Guatemalan highlands that were buried in his memory.</p><p>One of the birds in the chaos below was a scarlet ibis from the Caribbean island of Trinidad, where he was born in a dark, briny marsh known as the Caroni Swamp. From his very long beak to his even longer legs, he was a bright red, and the bright plumage at his head gave him a showy look, not completely inspiring trust. But despite the gaudiness, he was a startling beauty.</p><p>The scarlet ibis did not know what Trinidad was, but he did remember that he came from the Caroni Swamp. He would go there now except that he had no idea where it was. He remembered fishing for shrimp in black water with his long beak and the way his whole family, even cousins, would all settle into the same tree and enjoy the peace of sunset. Now there was no red light of sunset, only blackness and a bright round silver moon bigger than the eye of a giant.</p><p>He looked up and saw in the silver-bright light what the ancient Mayans had seen, the beauty of the red-and-green winged snake. The scarlet ibis himself was a god in the Caroni Swamp and the descendant of an ancient ibis that the Egyptians considered to be the moon god Thoth, who had invented language. He took three huge steps and folded his long thin legs under his red body and, spreading his enormous scarlet wings, took to the air, climbing over the Bronx until he was right next to the quetzal.</p><p>The two gods, the Winged Serpent and Thoth, felt good flying over the Bronx. The scarlet ibis felt that he was really flying for the first time in years, stretching his neck and his wings, feeling strong. He would not come down until he found the family tree in the Caroni Swamp. The winged snake could come with him if he wanted to.</p><p>But while he searched for the Caribbean swamp, the quetzal was in the highlands, dreaming. Flying and dreaming was what he was meant to do. Misty memories crept back, of a place where the little avocados were not scattered on the ground but grew on trees and the laurel was thick above the mountains and the clouds brushed the treetops above a red-and-black-soiled earth. These memories visited while he snaked through the air with his long tail.</p><p>The two flew into the night drunk, on their little sips of freedom.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>For a time they were gods and they needed only this feeling of flight. But where were they going and how to get there? Each wondered why the other was joining him. Were these the quetzal&#x2019;s highlands? Where was the ibis&#x2019;s swamp? Alone in the sky feels good for only a short time. They needed family. They needed other birds. So then they became companions because that was what they needed. Where were all the other birds? The ibis could not remember ever being this alone.</p><p>The quetzal had only one relative in North America, a cousin in Arizona called the coppery-tailed trogon, who was also green and red and white. He, too, was said to be very beautiful, but he was a trogon, not a quetzal, and the quetzal didn&#x2019;t know about him or Arizona. He knew only how to find the broken cage in the Bronx and he was considering returning.</p><p>The scarlet ibis, like most of New York,&nbsp;had relatives in Florida. The Florida relatives were pink flamingos, but to a scarlet ibis a pink flamingo is very pale, with bad eating habits. Instead of the pointed bill with which the ibis delicately picked through food, flamingos had a scoop for digging up mud, which they then sucked through strainers in their bills. He also had closer relatives on Long Island and in New Jersey, known as the glossy ibis, not as brightly colored and more common, but not known to him. He did not know where to find any birds and he, too, was considering heading back to the Bronx.</p><p>In truth, the scarlet ibis and the quetzal had been living a very easy life in the aviary, being fed gourmet meals and doing very little flying. Now they were getting tired and looked for a place to land. In the dark the expanse below shimmered like a forgotten moonlit sea somewhere that the ibis had once flown over.</p><p>But as the night sky turned purple and yellow on the edge of morning, they saw that this was something very different. They saw squares and boxes. They did not know that this was real estate, or how much it was worth in a seller&#x2019;s market, that it was honeycombed with monkeys even tunneling under the ground. They didn&#x2019;t even know that there were straight wide paths for machines that made monkeys move faster, only the machines moved too slowly because there were too many of them, or that there were panels selling things or posting warnings from Homeland Security. They knew none of this. All they knew was that this did not look like a good place for birds or for gods.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Ramona Pensky, who loved birds, was never going to give up her Fifth Avenue apartment. Where else in Manhattan could she wake up to birdsong? She went to court to keep her apartment facing the park. Once her lawyer revealed that her husband had <i>used</i> the World Trade Center attack, pretended to be caught downtown when he was two blocks away at Lydia Paulsen&#x2019;s apartment, shacking up while others were dying&#x2014;the lawyer was brilliant&#x2014;the apartment was awarded to her even though she could barely afford it. Every morning she listened to the birds, put on her embroidered Barneys slippers, strolled to the window, and gazed into the park anxiously on the toes of her slender feet. She was a small, delicate woman, and it would be easy to say that she resembled a bird, though most birds were smaller and had rounder bodies than did she. She wondered why from her apartment overlooking the park, no matter how hard she looked, she could not see the birds but only heard them. Very small birds, she supposed.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>The ibis and the quetzal spotted a spacious green rectangle. There were trees and lakes. The quetzal hoped the wooded hills might be his highlands and the scarlet ibis circled a marshy area to see if it was the Caroni Swamp. But his family tree wasn&#x2019;t there, and though it was not yet dawn, all the ibises seemed to have already left.</p><p>The quetzal slowly descended onto a tree branch, letting his long tail float into position like a parachute gracefully landing. A very large crow, maybe a raven, was staring at the quetzal in a way that made him uncomfortable, so he moved to a higher branch. The raven had only been thinking that it might be fun to pull on that tail.</p><p>The scarlet ibis landed his bright red plumage in an even higher branch, a swath of color looking too large to be a fruit but very ripe. They sat in silence in the tree as the morning light began to butter the green grass below. They were both thinking the same thing. They were hungry. This meant something entirely different for each of them. The quetzal was looking up, as quetzals do, and the ibis was looking down, as is their habit. What crustaceans were in the waters? What fruits were on the trees?</p><p>Instead they saw birds in the grass. They had brown coats and rust-colored breasts, not bad-looking birds, the two in the tree thought, but not nearly so beautiful that they should be strutting and sticking their chests out. They had that eagerness characteristic of smaller birds.</p><p>From their tree perches the two watched to see what food the rust-breasted birds were finding. The quetzal hoped they were looking for avocados, though they were not looking in the trees. The scarlet ibis hoped they were looking for shrimp, but they were not looking in the canals or at the water&#x2019;s edge. Then they realized.</p><p>The birds were eating worms. The quetzal and the scarlet ibis had seen birds eat bugs. In the Bronx they had seen the vermilion flycatcher&#x2014;very quick. But you didn&#x2019;t need to be quick to catch worms. The rust-breasted birds were very good at finding them, pulling them from the ground, holding the slithery things in their beaks and then swallowing them.</p><p>The ibis spread his scarlet wings and gently drifted to the ground. The quetzal followed. The scarlet ibis drilled the ground with his long beak and pulled out a worm. It was slippery and slithered off his beak. Hungry as he was, he did not really want to eat it. Suddenly they heard a group of voices like an ancient bird choir.</p><p>They looked up and saw that they were surrounded by angry little brown birds with rust chests. The brown birds did not want these two eating <i>their </i>worms. These brown rust-chested birds were robins and they seemed very proud of that. Their beaks turned almost red with pride&#x2014;or was it anger?</p><p>It was clear that this was not the Caroni Swamp or the highlands and they did not belong there and these American birds, the robins, did. The robins were the first birds of spring and they were entitled to the worms. Every place has its rules and those rules usually favor the local birds, which is why most birds prefer not to travel. They would see if the pigeons could help. Pigeons always know how to find food.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Dr. Ifigenio Sanchez stared at the sky. He shouldn&#x2019;t complain. He lost only two birds. Why those two? Why the ibis and the quetzal? Did they have stronger urges toward freedom than other birds? Stronger memories of home? Where would they go? They were not species that would adapt well to New York or the Northeast. Would they know to fly south? Dr. Sanchez suspected that they wouldn&#x2019;t go far. It was an unusually warm spring, so they might not get sick. But would they find food? How determined were they to feel freedom? And how long would that last? He alerted the city, the Audubon Society, and several New York bird-watcher groups. Now he could only wait.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>The scarlet ibis and the quetzal had run into pigeons before and nothing good had ever come of it. In the Bronx they didn&#x2019;t even allow pigeons inside. But it was a bird they knew&#x2014;knew a little, though they didn&#x2019;t understand them. Dr. Sanchez always called them rock doves. They were unimaginative hunters and they had good and durable marriages, neither being particularly admired traits in the bird world. But pigeons, even without hunting, were fat and always had food. That was because they knew how to get food from the monkeys, a useful skill.</p><p>And so the scarlet ibis and the quetzal put down the robins&#x2019; worms and went looking for the pigeons. Neither had ever personally met a pigeon, but they had often seen them outside the aviary. They were not difficult to find. Pigeons, the opposite of quetzals, were always found around the hairless monkeys, and the ibis called them boat birds because they always came into the swamp in boats. It took only a one-minute flight to locate a path that the monkey/boat birds used, and as the ibis and quetzal came in closer they could see it was crowded with fat, gray pigeons. They lowered themselves to the ground with great reluctance because the ibis did not like to expose himself to boat birds out of their boats and the quetzal didn&#x2019;t mind hairless monkeys outside the cage, but not in the open like this.</p><p>No sooner did the scarlet ibis have this thought while drifting down to the pavement than one of the boatless ones shouted to the other, &#x201c;Look! It&#x2019;s one of those birds we saw in Florida!&#x201d;</p><p>They thought he was a flamingo, but the scar...</p></p><h2>Maxwell the Outsider</h2><p>Traces the life of the controversial British publisher, recounts how he built his empire, and examines the charges of mismanagement that surfaced after his mysterious death</p><p>Publishing mogul Robert Maxwell drowned in November 1991. By December this book was being readied for publication. Originally published in Britain in 1988 amidst much legal ballyhoo, it never made it to the States--Maxwell saw to that. It is newly updated, exhaustively researched, and, at times, tediously detailed, especially concerning Maxwell's fi nancial dealings; it is also an even-handed account of a powerful and destructive egomaniac. Bower writes, "This is a story about a man who used and abused people, who aroused fervent loyalty, fear and disdain among otherwise rational and strong human beings, and whose reputation suffered the misfortune of his best attempts to offer his truth." Other accounts of Maxwell were also published in 1988: Joe Haines's Maxwell (Macdonald, a Maxwell company) and Peter Thompson's Maxwell: A Portrait of Power (Bantam). This is an important addition to communications, history, business, and even legal collections, as it is also a study of censorship and terrorism.

"The Road to Recovery," a previously unpublished novella, amusingly mixes a Hope-Crosby road movie with space opera. In the title story, Frost turns Horace Walpole's Prince Manfred into a Southern racist upon whose Castle of Otranto&#x2013;like plantation rain jazz instruments of destruction.

Yet, because this movement alarmed government officials, culminating in the infamous massacre at Wounded Knee of 250 Lakota men, women, and children, historical accounts have most often described the Ghost Dance from the perspective of the white Americans who opposed it. In <i>A Whirlwind Passed through Our Country</i>, historian Rani-Henrik Andersson instead gives Lakotas a sounding board, imparting the multiplicity of Lakota voices on the Ghost Dance at the time.<br><br> Whereas early accounts treated the Ghost Dance as a military or political movement, <i>A Whirlwind Passed through Our Country </i>stresses its peaceful nature and reveals the breadth of Lakota views on the subject. The more than one hundred accounts compiled here show that the movement caused friction within Lakota society even as it spurred genuine religious belief. These accounts, many of them never before translated from the original Lakota or published, demonstrate that the Ghost Dance&#x2019;s message resonated with Lakotas across artificial &#x201c;progressive&#x201d; and &#x201c;nonprogressive&#x201d; lines. Although the movement was often criticized as backward and disconnected from the harsh realities of Native life, Ghost Dance adherents were in fact seeking new ways to survive, albeit not those that contemporary whites envisioned for them. The Ghost Dance, Andersson suggests, might be better understood as an innovative adaptation by the Lakotas to the difficult situation in which they found themselves&#x2014;and as a way of finding a path to a better life.<br><br> By presenting accounts of divergent views among the Lakota people, <i>A Whirlwind Passed through Our Country</i> expands the narrative of the Ghost Dance, encouraging more nuanced interpretations of this significant moment in Lakota and American history.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Raymond J. DeMallie</b> is Chancellor's Professor of Anthropology and American Indian Studies at Indiana University.<i>&#x201c;A Whirlwind Passed through Our Country</i> is an exceptionally valuable addition to the literature on the Ghost Dance. Rani-Henrik Andersson has assembled by far the most comprehensive collection of primary sources on the Lakota Ghost Dance, including many he has skillfully translated from Lakota. His introduction and commentary provide excellent guidance into the diversity of Lakota voices that speak about this vitally important movement.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Jeffrey Ostler</b>, author of <i>The Lakotas and the Black Hills: The Struggle for Sacred Ground</i><br> &nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;In&nbsp;<i>A Whirlwind Passed through Our Country</i>, Rani-Henrik Andersson&nbsp;has made a major contribution to history and anthropology,&nbsp;recovering lost Lakota voices that henceforth will echo through every scholarly and public conversation about the Ghost Dance revival of 1889&#x2013;1890.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Louis S.

Not quite Gods, they embody realms of psychic experience: Dream, Desire, Despair, Destiny, Delirium, Destruction and Gaiman's very popular character, Death. Reaper, yes; but Death's not very grim as she goes about her business visiting the just-about-to-die and ushering them into their new existence. In this story she meets Sexton, a teenager contemplating suicide, and they end up searching New York City to find a witch's heart (the old hag hid it centuries ago, it's a witch tradition), so the old girl can hide it again. Up pops the Eremite, an evil wizard type, out to steal Death's mysterious necklace, who makes the usual threats against life and limb. Gaiman has created a character sweetly at odds with her modbid duties; dressed like a Satanic rocker, she's as pretty as a cheerleader and even more upbeat. While Gaiman brings a gritty urban contemporaneity to the fantasy genre, the story also suffers from a TV script-like sensibility--danger-defying quips, the good-hearted overweight black neighbor, melodramatic villain. Nevertheless the combination of wry mystic immortal and MTV slacker produces an engaging chemistry. Top-notch production, and although the illustration is a bit stiff, it's stylishly rendered and very nicely colored. The introduction is by pop singer Tori Amos. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Kingdom&#39;s Fury (Starfist, Book 8)</h2><p><b><i>A few good Marines beat the fierce, fanatical aliens once before. But that was a skirmish&#x2013;not a full-scale invasion.<br></i><br></b>The truth is out. No longer are the Skinks just a horrible secret haunting the Marines of Company L. Now the aliens are all-too-real invaders whose savage attacks have devastated planet Kingdom, a world of squabbling religions where the men of the 34th FIST confront a desperate situation. Cities that haven&#x2019;t already been reduced to rubble are under siege, while starving refugees roam the land. And still the Skinks come, rising from stinking primordial swamps to slake their thirst for slaughter, armed with an uncanny ability to locate the enemy and with weapons so deadly that a single blast can drop a warplane or a decimate a squad.<br><br>It&#x2019;s painfully evident that 34th FIST is no match for these near-invincible killers, which is why third platoon&#x2019;s been ordered to whip the citizens of Kingdom into fighting shape. With their backs to the wall and time running out, there&#x2019;s only one way the Marines can turn these timid, quarrelsome men into warriors: Take the battle to the enemy. It&#x2019;s a brilliant strategy, sure to succeed&#x2013;if it doesn&#x2019;t get them killed first. . . .</p><p><b>David Sherman</b> is a former United States Marine and the author of eight previously published novels about Marines in Vietnam, where he served as an infantryman and as a member of a Combined Action Platoon.

He is the author of <i>Inside the VC and the NVA</i> (with Michael Lee Lanning), <i>Top Sergeant</i> (with William G. Bainbridge), and a Vietnam War novel, <i>The Soldier&#x2019;s Prize</i>. In real life, Mr. Cragg is an analyst for the Defense Department. He and his wife, Sunny, live in Virginia, where honest citizens are allowed to pack heat.Captain Conorado, just returned from his court-martial on Earth, nodded when his officers and senior noncommissioned officers finished bringing him up to date. "All right. Mac," he said, addressing Lieutenant Rokmonov, the assault platoon commander, "you take over third platoon. Wang," to Staff Sergeant Hyakowa, acting platoon commander of third platoon, "you're back to platoon sergeant again. Top," First Sergeant Myer, the company's top kick, "you've got the roster of replacements. Let me know how you assign them. Some of your Marines are going to move into billets above their rank. As soon as I have your new rosters, I'll pass the names up to Battalion for promotion. And make sure Souavi gets those new uniforms issued.<br><br>"In the meanwhile, 26th FIST is relieving us on the line. Tomorrow we begin kicking some serious Skink ass!"<br><br>The officers aye aye'd and headed to their platoons. The platoon sergeants followed the first sergeant to get their replacements and find out what the "new uniforms" were about.<br><br>"Siddown," Myer growled when he and the platoon sergeants reached his desk. They pulled up chairs and sat close. "Wang, remember that sample of acid third platoon brought back from Society 437?"<br><br>Hyakowa nodded. "Yeah. That doctor we had with us thought it had a phosphoric base with some sort of organic solvent."<br><br>"Well, someone at Headquarters, Marine Corps, came up with a good idea for a change. They figured sooner or later Marines would run into the Skinks again and we'd need some defense against that acid. They analyzed the hell out of that sample until they knew what it was. Then they sent it to Aberdeen to develop an antidote and a retardant." He shook his head. "They haven't managed to come up with an antidote, so we're stuck with the old ways of dealing with the acid on flesh: small doses are to be cut out of the flesh before they eat all the way through; larger amounts will eat flesh and bone until they kill, unless you immediately amputate the limb. If it's a trunk or deep head wound . . ." he paused, and shook his head again. "Aberdeen did manage to develop a retardant, an impregnator for the chameleons. It won't protect flesh, but it will stop the acid from eating its way through the chameleons so a Marine wearing an impregnated uniform is protected."<br><br>"Does it really work?" Hyakowa asked. The other platoon sergeants had the same question. Almost anyone with combat experience knew that more than half of the "technological advances" or "improvements" in weapons or equipment didn't work the way they were supposed to when they were subjected to the harsh realities of combat.<br><br>Myer shrugged. "Who the hell knows? The retardant was tested against acid the chemists at Aberdeen cooked up, but nobody knows if that acid is the exact same as the Skinks'. We aren't going to know until a Marine wearing impregnated chameleons gets hit by the real thing."<br><br>"What effect does it have on the chameleon effect?" one of the other platoon sergeants asked.<br><br>Myer glared at him. He didn't like being asked questions he didn't have answers for. "What'd I just say? The damn things haven't seen combat yet. But they claim it has no effect, the chameleon effect still works." He shook his head. "Not that chameleons seem to give a hell of a lot of protection against the Skinks. Maybe they can see in the infrared like those bird-creatures on Avionia. Maybe they have some other sense that allows them to sense us some other way."<br><br>"Whatever." Myer sat back and slapped a palm on his desktop to end the discussion. "Twenty-sixth FIST brought an extra thousand sets of chameleons, enough for everybody left in 34th FIST to get one, with some extras." He shook his head sadly; he hated losing Marines. "We had more casualties than they realized. Anyway, send people to Supply this afternoon, Sergeant Souavi will have them in stock. Your people can pick up one for each of your Marines. The new men already have theirs. Speaking of which--" He picked up a few slips of paper from his desktop and handed them out. "--these are your new men. Don't spend them all in one place, it's liable to be a long time before we get any more."<br><br>He took them outside to where the new men waited and called them out to join their new platoon sergeants. Rokmonov was waiting for Hyakowa. As long as he'd been with Company L, he was a new man too, with third platoon now.<br><br>The general mood in 34th FIST was, if not jubilant, at least relieved. After months of combating an implacable enemy who was hellishly difficult to find, and suffering the heaviest casualties most of them had ever experienced, they were finally reinforced and had replacements for their losses. Not that the new men could fully replace their dead. Close friendships had ended with the lost lives. Although new friendships can grow just as close as old ones, the new friends can never truly replace those lost.<br><br>The mood in Company L of 34th FIST's infantry battalion was perhaps higher than anywhere else. Captain Conorado was back. Lieutenant Humphrey, the company's executive officer, was well-liked and had filled in admirably during Conorado's absence, but nearly everyone in the company had been through multiple operations and deployments with Conorado. Nearly every man in Company L trusted their company commander to a degree they trusted no other officer.<br><br>So it was a jocular third platoon that greeted its newcomers when they assembled in the shell of a building that had been nearly demolished by the Skinks' antiarmor weapon. The shell was a couple hundred meters inside the perimeter. Even though they were surrounded by evidence of how far the Skink weapons could reach, just being off the defensive line made them feel they were out of danger, at least for the moment.<br><br>The men of third platoon took the assignment of Lieutenant Rokmonov as their new commander with equanimity. If lost friends could never be fully replaced, neither could their late platoon commander, Gunnery Sergeant Charlie Bass. But they all knew Rokmonov. The grizzled officer had been a gunnery sergeant before he was commissioned. If they didn't think he was going to be as good a platoon commander as Charlie Bass had been, well, nobody was that good, but Rokmonov was probably as good as they came. Like Charlie Bass, he'd been filling a platoon commander's billet on a semipermanent basis. Rokmonov finally broke down and accepted an ensign's silver orbs when 411th FIST, which he was then in, had a sudden influx of company grade officers, one of whom got his platoon. He didn't want to ever again lose his job to a man who had probably recently been junior to him in rank--most Marine officers were sergeants or staff sergeants when they got commissioned.<br><br>Third platoon didn't get enough replacements to fill all of its eight vacancies so maybe Sergeant Bladon and Corporal Goudanis would return. For some men of third platoon, the arrival of the new men was cause for celebration.<br><br>"Rat," Rokmonov said to Corporal Linsman, the acting second squad leader since Sergeant Bladon was evacuated, "the paperwork goes in today to get you your sergeant's stripes."<br><br>"Welcome aboard, Rat," Sergeant Ratliff said. He slapped Linsman's shoulder with his left hand while flexing his right fist.<br><br>"Thanks, Rabbit." Linsman grinned, but cast a wary eye at Ratliff's fist. The Confederation Marines still "pinned on the stripes," so every newly promoted man was punched in the shoulder once for each chevron by any enlisted man who held the same or higher rank.<br><br>"Way to go, Rat!" Corporal Dornhofer called out.<br><br>"Ya mean I got to call you 'Sergeant' now?" Corporal Pasquin cried.<br><br>The others added congratulations, even Corporal Kerr. Linsman was the second corporal in the platoon to make sergeant who had been junior to Kerr when Kerr was almost killed and had to spend nearly two years in recuperation.<br><br>"We need a new gun team leader," Rokmonov said when he thought the congratulations had gone on long enough. "Taylor, you don't have to hump the gun anymore, your new corporal's chevrons will be enough weight."<br><br>Lance Corporal Taylor grinned widely and happily accepted congratulations for his promotion to gun team leader.<br><br>Rokmonov looked at Hyakowa and nodded for him to take over.<br><br>Hyakowa stepped forward and studied the platoon roster for a moment. "This is a sad day for third platoon," he finally said. "We need two fire team leaders, but nobody thought to give us experienced corporals." He shook his head morosely. "What I'd really like to do is make Schultz a fire team leader, but we all know how he'd react to that." Schultz was a career lance corporal; if anyone tried to promote him, he'd turn it down--angrily and, some feared, violently. "As hard as it is to believe, the only other lance corporals we have in the blaster squads are Claypoole and Dean." He looked apologetically at Ratliff and Linsman. "I'm really sorry to have to do this to you, but do you think you can manage if I give each of you one of them as a fire team leader?"<br><br>Ratliff grinned wolfishly as he waited for the hooting and laughter to ebb slightly, then said in a parade-ground voice, "Gimme Dean. I'll break him in or break him."<br><br>Dean's face was a flickering mix of joy and indignancy.<br><br>"What?" Linsman squawked. "You mean you're going to stick me with Clay-- Wait a minute. If Rabbit gets Claypoole, that means I get stuck with Dean." He worked his face into a grandly overacted fury and shouted at Hyakowa, "Are you trying to ruin my promotion?"<br><br>Claypoole first beamed, then shot a furiously offended look at Linsman, which set off fresh gales of hoots and laughter.<br><br>Hyakowa looked at the second squad leader blandly and said in a calm voice, "Corporal, soon to be Sergeant, Linsman, may I remind you that you are a Marine noncommissioned officer? As such, you are supposed to do more with less than anybody else in Human Space. And make it look easy. I fully expect you to take Claypoole and turn him into just as good a fire team leader as . . . as . . ." He shook his head again. "What am I saying? No, it's not possible to turn him into as good a fire team leader as Kerr, or even Chan." He nodded sagely. "But you can turn him into a reasonable facsimile."<br><br>Claypoole glared at Hyakowa; he didn't think that was funny.<br><br>"Rabbit," Hyakowa returned to Ratliff, "I have full confidence in your ability to turn Dean into . . ." His eyes went distant and he shook his head again. "I'll talk to the Top. Maybe I can get him to give us a corporal from one of the other platoons."<br><br>It was Dean's turn to glare and endure the hoots and laughs.<br><br>"As you were!" Rokmonov shouted after a moment. "We have some new people." He nodded toward six Marines who stood slightly apart from the platoon and hadn't joined in the laughter. "I'll let Staff Sergeant Hyakowa introduce them to you while I give the promotion recommendations to the Skipper. Staff Sergeant, the platoon is yours."<br><br>"Sir, the platoon is mine. Aye aye." Nobody bothered to call the platoon to attention; they weren't even standing in formation. Not when at any instant they might have to bolt back to fighting positions on the defensive perimeter. Hyakowa watched Rokmonov head for the company command post, then turned back to the men.<br><br>"We have one new lance corporal, name of Zumwald." He gestured for the gangly, redheaded new man to identify himself. "Lance Corporal Zumwald was in the security company at Headquarters, Marine Corps, when he got pulled for this assignment." He glanced at the roster. "So were PFCs Gray and Shoup." He looked back at the platoon. "Don't let their ranks and latest assignments fool you. All of these Marines have a couple of combat deployments with FISTs under their belts. No cherries here. Rabbit, you've got those three. Put one in each fire team."<br><br>"Roger," Ratliff said, nodding. He crooked a finger at his three new men.<br><br>"I'm giving you Longfellow as well. Sorry about that," he added to Linsman.<br><br>"Good," Ratliff said. Longfellow hadn't been with the platoon long, but Ratliff had seen enough to know he was a good Marine. Linsman merely shrugged at losing Longfellow.<br><br>"Linsman, you get Little and Fisher."<br><br>"Right." Linsman waved his two new men over.<br><br>"Hound," Hyakowa said to Sergeant Kelly, the gun squad leader, "move your a-gunners up. Sorry I only have one humper for you, but that's all they gave us. His name's Tischler.<br><br>"One more piece of business," Hyakowa said when Tischler moved to the gun squad. "We've got new uniforms coming. I want one man from each squad to go to Supply to pick them up. They're chameleons that are supposed to be impervious to the acid in the Skinks' shooters. From now on you will wear them." He looked at the men to see if anyone had a pressing question. None seemed to.<br><br>"That is all," he finished. "Squad leaders, let me know how you reorganize your squads."<br><br>The squad leaders took their men aside.<br><br>"Now I've got all my troublemakers together where I can keep an eye on you," Sergeant Ratliff said when he gave Godenov to Dean.<br><br>Linsman said the same thing when he assigned MacIlargie to Claypoole.<br><br>Claypoole's expression showed he was a bit put out. Not because he had MacIlargie, whom he liked, but because he only had MacIlargie in his fire team.<br><br>Corporal Kerr didn't show it, but he wondered why he retained Schultz and Corporal Doyle instead of getting a new man. Did Hyakowa and Rokmonov really think Chan could do a better job of integrating two new men into the squad than he could?<br><br>Nobody but the new men wondered why Corporal Doyle wasn't given a fire team.<br><br>Both as the more senior brigadier and as the man with the local experience, Theodosius Sturgeon, commander of 34th Fleet Initial Strike Team, was in overall command of planetside operations on the Kingdom of Yahweh and His Saints and Their Apostles, more commonly called "Kingdom." As such, he wanted to get 26th FIST involved as quickly as possible and gave it patrol duty its second day planetside. Brigadier Johannes Sparen, commander of 26th FIST, was relieved he didn't have to ask Sturgeon to give his FIST a mission beyond the defensive perimeter they were fed into as soon as they debarked from the Dragons that had ferried them from the orbital shuttles.<br><br>"Jack, the Skinks may have an innocent sounding name," Sturgeon said, "but they're exceptionally dangerous. They have horrible weapons, and they're unpredictable. I want you to put out patrols in force tomorrow, platoon size. And I want them in constant radio contact with Battalion. My staff is very familiar with the situation here." The situation here on Kingdom was unlike any he'd been in before. "Until you're familiar enough, I'll instruct my Infantry Two and Three shops to give any assistance yours request. Just until your people are familiarized with the situation. My infantrymen will relieve your platoons on the line before dawn tomorrow so your people can get an early start."</p><h2>Bear&#39;s Loose Tooth</h2><p>From a cave in the forest came a munch, munch, crunch as bear and his friends all nibbled on their lunch.</p><p></p><h2>The Gettysburg Address</h2><p>Originally published by Random House in a black-and-white edition in 1994, Sam Fink is returning to <i>The Gettysburg Address</i> to bring out this full-color edition, complete with original illustrations and hand-lettering.

Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations �1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P.

Despite the name, Video-Glam appeared to be anything but glamorous. The office was located in a mostly dead and partly repurposed strip mall at Indian School and Forty-third Avenue. Video-Glam occupied a single storefront at one end of the complex. At the other end, two units had been combined to serve as a Spanish-language Baptist church. In between were three empty units, their boarded-up windows a colorful catalog of three-foot-high graffiti.<br> <br>For a moment, Gemma sat in her car with the engine running, wondering if she wanted to bother going inside. From the outside, it didn&#x2019;t look the least bit promising, even though the membership consultant at Hearts Afire, a dating site for &#x201c;mature singles,&#x201d; had assured her that Video-Glam was the only place in Phoenix that they would recommend as a source for uploadable videos.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like Glamour Shots,&#x201d; the young woman had told her, &#x201c;only with, like you know, videos instead of just pictures.&#x201d;<br> <br>That comment had told Gemma a lot about the age and general qualifications of her membership consultant without engendering a whole lot of confidence in the process itself.<br> <br>She was considering putting the SLK in reverse and backing out of the lot when a car pulled in beside her. It was a dusty green Subaru months beyond needing a complete detailing. A collection of doggy nose prints on the inside of the back side window obscured the interior of the car but let the world know that a large dog of some kind was often a backseat passenger.<br> <br>The woman who hopped out of the driver&#x2019;s seat, a bedraggled thirtysomething, matched the car in every way. She looked harried and overworked and, from the way she hotfooted it inside, most likely late for an appointment. She was dressed in a pair of faded black sweats topped by a worn football jersey from Glendale High School. The whole woebegone outfit was underscored by a pair of blue rubber flip-flops. Stringy dishwater-blond hair was pulled back with a scrunchy. As far as Gemma was concerned, the woman looked like crap.<br> <br>Gemma&#x2019;s first thought was that this was someone desperately in need of a little glamour. Her second thought was along the lines of &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s the competition, I&#x2019;m home free.&#x201d;<br> <br>Based on that, Gemma couldn&#x2019;t help being a little curious if anyone at Video-Glam would be able to wave a magic wand at the poor unfortunate creature who was standing in front of the reception desk just inside the front door. Without really thinking about it, Gemma switched off the ignition, grabbed a small suitcase with her changes of wardrobe off the passenger-side floor as well as her out-of-season mink from its place of honor on the passenger seat.<br> <br>Once inside, Gemma saw that the woman from the dusty Subaru was still ahead of her at the reception counter and in a full-scale case of hysterics. &#x201c;I know I have to move on,&#x201d; she sobbed, dabbing at her tears. &#x201c;But I just don&#x2019;t know how to do it. I&#x2019;ve been out of the dating scene for so long that the whole idea scares me to death.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; the much-pierced young woman behind the counter reassured her, passing along a box of tissues. This was evidently a situation she had dealt with on more than one occasion. As the weeping woman blew into one of the offered tissues, Gemma noticed the pale spot on the skin of the woman&#x2019;s ring finger from which, most likely, a wedding band had been recently removed.<br> <br>Gemma felt a tiny stirring of irritation. It made no sense that she&#x2019;d be in remotely the same boat as this unfortunate creature. If Charles had simply manned up and done what she had expected him to do&#x2014;which was live up to his potential&#x2014;things never would have come to this pass. He had told her that he would one day be a surgeon, and that was what she had expected. Had he done so, Gemma would have gotten a reasonable return on her investment, and she wouldn&#x2019;t have had to dump him. Instead, after one stupid mistake&#x2014;and one lost patient who probably wouldn&#x2019;t have survived anyway&#x2014;he had backed away from surgery and become a raving do-gooder. The money he made looking after Alzheimer&#x2019;s patients was far less than she had planned on. And since all these patients were going to die, too, what was the point?<br> <br>Gemma had decided to cut her losses and look for greener pastures while she could. Fortunately, she was starting over with a lot more going for her than Ms. Flip-flops, standing as if frozen in front of the receptionist, who slid a credit card and a receipt across the counter. The woman signed it and stuffed her copy in her purse. At that moment, another young woman, this one dressed entirely in black, stepped through an interior door into the reception area.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, hi, Noelle,&#x201d; the receptionist said. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s your stylist, Rachel. She&#x2019;s the one who&#x2019;ll be helping you today. Just go with her and don&#x2019;t worry about a thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Looking more than a little lost, Rachel allowed herself to be led away while Gemma stepped up to the receptionist and tossed her fur on the counter in front of her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is she here for Hearts Afire?&#x201d; Gemma asked, nodding toward the door where Rachel and her stylist had disappeared.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, no.&#x201d; The receptionist&#x2019;s smile was one step short of a purr. &#x201c;We do videos for several different sites. If you&#x2019;re with Hearts Afire, you must be Gemma.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gemma had to beat back her first inclination, which was to say, &#x201c;Ms. Ralston to you.&#x201d; She nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here for my ten o&#x2019;clock,&#x201d; she said, pulling out her Amex card.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re aware of our charges?&#x201d; the receptionist asked. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re paying for the shoot only, as well as your initial upload. We keep the videos on file, and you&#x2019;re charged a nominal fee each time you ask to have them uploaded on another site.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, yes,&#x201d; Gemma agreed impatiently. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Now that she was here, what she wanted more than anything was to get the process over and done with, sort of like going to the dentist for a root canal. She already knew it was going to be bad. The only question was how long it would take.<br> <br>The receptionist ran Gemma&#x2019;s card, then passed back the card and receipt as the interior door opened again and yet another black-clad young woman appeared.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is Roxanne,&#x201d; the receptionist announced to Gemma. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be your stylist today.&#x201d;<br> <br>Roxanne was young&#x2014;probably not over twenty-five&#x2014;but as Gemma examined the young woman&#x2019;s hair and makeup, she could find nothing to complain about. Roxanne was naturally good-looking to begin with, and her carefully applied makeup and precision-cut bob added to her appeal. So maybe, Gemma thought hopefully, with any kind of luck, with someone like that doing the styling, it wouldn&#x2019;t be all that bad.<br> <br>Gemma picked up her coat and suitcase and allowed herself to be led into the next section of the building, which turned out to be a tiny but exceedingly well-equipped beauty salon. There were four stations in all, two for hair and two for makeup. Off to the side was a walled-off section with a door marked WARDROBE.<br> <br>&#x201c;Most people stop here first and choose their outfits. That way we can be sure we have the right makeup,&#x201d; Roxanne explained, pointing toward the door. &#x201c;Once you choose what to wear, we&#x2019;ll select which of our backdrops you&#x2019;ll want once we get to the studio.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need any of that stuff,&#x201d; Gemma told her stylist. &#x201c;I brought my own.&#x201d;<br> <br>As they walked by the wardrobe door, Gemma noticed that Rachel, the dishwater blonde, was inside trying on a Harley-Davidson jacket. A discarded stack of obviously fake furs lay on the floor beside her.<br> <br>At a table outside the wardrobe, Gemma opened her valise and laid out her three different outfits. Eventually, they settled on her favorite, a chartreuse silk sheath that came complete with a pair of high-heeled strappy sandals.<br> <br>Roxanne nodded approvingly and then brought up a series of photos on a laptop. One showed a summery garden through the rail of what was evidently a front porch. &#x201c;We have a porch swing that we use with this one,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That will be perfect with the dress.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What should we use for the mink?&#x201d; Gemma asked, wanting to be certain Roxanne understood that her coat was the real thing, not some rip-off fake.<br> <br>Roxanne clicked through a series of photos. &#x201c;What about this one?&#x201d; she said, pausing on what looked like a snow-covered Swiss chalet. &#x201c;I think this one will do it justice. Believe it or not, we have some perfectly wonderful faux snow back in the studio that looks just like the real thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>By the time they finished background-shopping, Rachel had emerged from wardrobe, and the change was nothing short of miraculous. Noelle had evidently persuaded her to skip the Harley-Davidson jacket in favor of a sapphire wraparound dress with a plunging neckline and simple, flowing lines that evidently could be adjusted to fit almost any figure. The flip-flops had disappeared, replaced by a pair of classy pumps dyed to match the dress. The wardrobe department at Video-Glam apparently had a whole selection of shoes in all kinds of sizes to go with the very adjustable dress.<br> <br>Roxanne went to work shampooing Gemma&#x2019;s hair. When she was finished, Gemma noticed that Rachel&#x2019;s formerly drab locks had been lightened by some kind of rinse and were trimmed swiftly but deftly. Once the new cut had been blow-dried, combed, and sprayed, Rachel looked like a different person entirely. The revised hairdo was followed by the meticulous application of makeup that took a full ten years off her face. Watching from the sidelines while her own hair was being shampooed and styled, Gemma couldn&#x2019;t help but be impressed. The sophisticated look made Rachel a different person, smiling and laughing and maybe enjoying herself for the first time in a long time. But the change in appearance didn&#x2019;t change the fact that Rachel had arrived for her shoot in a filthy Subaru with dog snot all over the windows.<br> <br>&#x201c;Noelle&#x2019;s really great,&#x201d; Roxanne commented. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s especially good with the broken birds. She makes them look good, but she also makes them feel good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about me?&#x201d; Gemma asked.<br> <br>Roxanne stopped and gave Gemma an appraising look. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ve ever been a broken bird,&#x201d; the stylist said with a laugh. &#x201c;By the time I&#x2019;m finished with you, though, you&#x2019;ll be spectacular.&#x201d;<br> <br>Which turned out to be the case. Roxanne made no effort to adjust Gemma&#x2019;s already perfect haircut, but she did put just the right amount of curl and body into it, and the skillfully applied makeup left Gemma smiling and nodding at her reflection.<br> <br>&#x201c;You like?&#x201d; Roxanne asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Very much,&#x201d; Gemma answered.<br> <br>When Gemma&#x2019;s makeover was complete, Roxanne led her into the greenroom, where it was time to hurry up and wait. Rachel had disappeared into the studio before Gemma&#x2019;s makeup was finished. While she waited, Gemma pulled out a hard copy of the script she intended to use. It was supposed to be three to five minutes long and would be transferred to a teleprompter before the actual filming. She had struggled with what to say. She wanted to hit all the right notes&#x2014;breezy, fun, lighthearted. She didn&#x2019;t want people to think she took herself too seriously. Guys who were interested in fun and games weren&#x2019;t looking for serious.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Gemma,&#x201d; the script read. &#x201c;With a name like that, it&#x2019;s only natural that I have a soft spot for gems, two in particular: emeralds because they match my eyes, and diamonds because diamonds really are a girl&#x2019;s best friend.&#x201d;<br> <br>It seemed to her that simple introduction made it clear she was looking for someone with dollars in his wallet that he&#x2019;d be willing to spend on her. Cubic zirconia? Thanks but no thanks! Not her type.<br> <br>The script continued, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for companionship, but I have no interest in getting married again.&#x201d; (Lose out on her hard-earned alimony? Not on your life!) &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m definitely not interested in kids. If I had wanted kids, I would have had my own. If you&#x2019;ve got kids, I&#x2019;m sure they have mothers who don&#x2019;t need any competition in the motherhood department. I&#x2019;ll be glad to meet your kids, but I don&#x2019;t want to raise them or take them away from their real moms.<br> <br>&#x201c;Without kids or marriage on the table, my age is none of your business. I believe in being open-minded as far as age is concerned, in both directions, up and down. If you&#x2019;re looking at this video and thinking I&#x2019;m probably too old for you or too young, then you&#x2019;re probably right. So let&#x2019;s not even go there.<br> <br>&#x201c;By now you&#x2019;re probably wondering, So what does she really want?<br> <br>&#x201c;In a word&#x2014;fun! I&#x2019;ve spent enough of my life knowing that tomorrow would be a repeat of today. I want to be able to expect the unexpected. I want adventure. A white-water rafting trip down the Colorado? I&#x2019;m there. An African safari? Yes; have passport, will travel. A sunset walk along a sandy beach, yes. A quiet evening of reading books in a snowbound cabin? Yes to that, too. Maybe you&#x2019;re into long-distance bicycling and would like to help me train. I&#x2019;d also like to try my hand at ballroom dancing and bowling.<br> <br>&#x201c;In other words, the boring day-to-day stuff is fine for me to do by myself, but when I&#x2019;m with you&#x2014;whoever you are&#x2014;nothing that sounds like fun is off the table, and the sooner we get started, the better.&#x201d;<br> <br>Noelle emerged from the studio looking perplexed. &#x201c;Sorry for the delay,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Rachel looks great, but she keeps freezing up the moment the camera starts recording. It shouldn&#x2019;t be long, but the director was wondering if you brought along a copy of your script. If so, he wants me to start loading it into the teleprompter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No problem,&#x201d; Gemma said, smiling and handing it over. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be ready when you are.&#x201d;<br> <br>With that, she settled in to wait. She knew she looked good. She knew that before long, she&#x2019;d have men groveling at her feet, but she also knew who to thank for it&#x2014;her grandmother Natalie Hooper.<br> <br>Gemma didn&#x2019;t remember the roach-infested hovel from which her grandparents had rescued her as a two-year-old, although her grandmother, also known as Nana, had told her about it so many times that she could see it in her mind&#x2019;s eye. Two days after Gemma&#x2019;s second birthday, Nana and Papa had gone to war with their drug-addicted daughter, Caroline.<br> <br>Born with what should have been a silver spoon in her mouth, Caroline Hooper was the daughter of a small-town physician and a stay-at-home mom. Money was never an issue in their Lake Havasu home. In grade school and junior high, things were fine. Caroline got good grades and was considered an exemplary student, but once she got into high school, that all went south. By the time she turned fifteen, she was a pot-smoking dropout. By the time she was eighteen, she had an out-of-wedlock baby and a serious drug problem. For a time, Natalie and Daniel Hooper had done what they could to care for both their struggling daughter and her baby girl&#x2014;paying rent and utility bills; sending money and gift certificates for groceries.<br> <br>Caroline had told them that she was having a birthday party on Gemma&#x2019;s birthday, and it would be too complicated to try to include her parents. Two days later, Natalie and Daniel had turned up unannounced, expecting to deliver a stack of tardy birthday presents. They knocked, but no one answered, even though they could hear Gemma crying from somewhere inside. Finding the door unlocked, they let themselves into a nightmare. The apartment was filthy. The place was littered with empty pizza boxes. Cockroaches scurried out of...</p><h2>The Western Front 1914-1916: From the Schlieffen Plan to Verdun and the Somme (History of WWI)</h2><p>The Western Front, running from the Belgian coast in the north to the Swiss border in the south, was to prove the decisive battlefront of World War I. It was where the great powers of Germany, France and the British Empire concentrated the bulk of their military might, and it was where many believed the war would be settled before Christmas 1914. The German General Staff realised the dangers of fighting a two-front war against both France and Russia simultaneously. They sought to knock the French out of the war quickly, making a rapid advance on Paris through neutral Belgium &#x2013; the infamous 'Schlieffen Plan'. After desperate delaying actions fought by the French and British armies, the German hope for swift victory in the West was thwarted by their defeat at the First Battle of the Marne. Following a 'Race to the Sea' &#x2013; where each side sought to outflank the other, culminating in the battles of First Ypres and the Yser &#x2013; the Western Front settled down into a pattern of trench warfare that would remain little changed until 1917. The year 1915 proved one of frustration for the Allies as attack after attack &#x2013; in Champagne, at Neuve Chapelle, Festubert and Loos &#x2013; all failed to pierce the German defensive lines. To break the deadlock, a joint Allied offensive was planned for 1916 with simultaneous attacks against the Central Powers to take place in all the European theatres. This planned major effort was pre-empted by the German assault on the fortress city of Verdun, intended to bleed the French Army dry. The joint Somme offensive thus became a largely British and Imperial affair to relieve the pressure on their French allies. The blooding of Kitchener's volunteer New Army on the first day of the Somme has become a byword for the slaughter on the Western Front. By the year's end, it was clear there would be no easy victory for either side.<br> With the aid of over 300 photographs, complemented by full-color maps, <i>The Western Front 1914&#x2013;1916</i> provides a detailed guide to the background and conduct of the conflict on the Western Front in the first half of the war, up to and including the Battles of the Somme and Verdun.</p><p>Michael S.

A secretary at Grapevine Canyon Ranch proposed a simple change to pull the company&#39;s website to the top of search engines. These are just two of many examples in &#34;&#34;Ideas Are Free that highlight the single best resource in a company--those frontline employees who can see those telling little details that escape managers. Based on extensive research with hundreds of companies around the world and in every major field, this practical book shows how to draw the most useful ideas from frontline employees and, in the process, significantly improve the atmosphere--and success quotient--of any organization.</p><p>Alan G.

Schroeder is currently the Herbert and Agnes Schulz Professor at the College of Business Administration at Valparaiso University.THE IDEA REVOLUTION<br><br> What will future generations say about the way we practice management today? What will they consider our most conspicuous failure?<br><br> We believe they will accuse us of having squandered one of the most significant resources available to us: employee ideas. Every day, all over the world, millions of working people see problems and opportunities that their managers do not. With little chance to do anything about them, they are forced to watch helplessly as their organizations waste money, disappoint and lose customers, and miss opportunity after opportunity that to them are all too apparent. The result is performance far lower than it should be and employees who do not respect or trust management and who are not fully engaged with their work.<br><br> At the same time, their managers are under constant pressure to do more with less. But with so much of their time consumed by &#x201c;firefighting&#x201d; and trying to meet short-term demands, they have little or no time to think about how to build their organizations&#x2019; capabilities. They are chronically short of the resources they need to keep performance at current levels, much less improve it. They wonder how to motivate their employees, who don&#x2019;t seem as involved in their work as they should be. In short, a great many managers today find their work stressful and unfulfilling. Because there seems to be no alternative, both managers and employees become jaded, and they accept the situation as the way things have to be.<br><br> But a quiet revolution is under way&#x2014;an idea revolution&#x2014;led by managers and supervisors who, in a small but growing number of companies, have learned how to listen systematically to their employees. With each implemented idea, performance improves in some way. Some time or money is saved, someone&#x2019;s job becomes a little easier, the customer experience is enhanced, or the organization is improved in some other way. With large numbers of ideas coming in, performance improves dramatically. And as employees see their ideas used, they know they are having an impact on their organization and become engaged in their work.<br><br> Why do we call this movement a revolution? We do so because it liberates people and transforms the way that organizations are run. It changes the nature of the relationship between managers and their employees. As Ray Winter, then president of BIC Corporation, observed about the effect of his company&#x2019;s idea system on the corporate culture:<br><br> This system has taught my managers real respect for their employees. My managers have learned that their employees can make them look awfully good, if they only let them.<br><br> This comment could easily be taken to mean that it does not take much&#x2014;other than receptiveness on the part of management&#x2014;to get large numbers of ideas from employees. But, just as it did the other companies we have studied, it took BIC years of experimentation and learning to discover how to tap this potential. There is a lot to learn, much of which goes against the initial assumptions most managers make about why people give ideas and which ideas are important.<br> WHAT&#x2019;S IN AN IDEA?<br><br> Ideas are the engine of progress. They improve people&#x2019;s lives by creating better ways to do things. They build and grow successful organizations and keep them healthy and prosperous. Without the ability to get new ideas, an organization stagnates and declines and eventually will be eliminated by competitors who do have fresh ideas.<br><br> An idea begins when a person becomes aware of a problem or opportunity, however small. Every day, regular employees&#x2014;the people who do the office work, make the products, and serve the customers&#x2014;see plenty of problems and opportunities and come up with good ideas about how to address them:<br> When accounting for oil purchases, a staffer in a regional distribution center of Deutsche Post, the German post office, noticed that the company was paying too much for the engine oil for its trucks. Drivers were buying oil at roadside service stations, paying the equivalent of $8.50 per liter. After some research, he found that Deutsche Post could buy the oil in bulk for a quarter of the price and proposed that it do so. At the time of this writing, the idea was being implemented at distribution centers across Germany. With tens of thousands of diesel trucks and vans on the road, it will no doubt save millions of euros every year.4<br> At Good Shepherd Services, a not-for-profit health care organization with a nursing home in northern Wisconsin, a group of employees learned in a training session that dementia patients often see areas of black flooring as holes and avoid them. Instead of using alarm bracelets or restraints to keep such patients from wandering into unsafe areas, the group suggested simply to paint the floor black in front of the doorways to these areas. The idea worked, and it not only reduced patient stress but saved staff considerable time because they no longer had to respond to alarms.<br> At LaSalle Bank, one of the largest banks in the United States, whenever someone requested a new laser printer, they were given the standard model specified by the purchasing department. One day, an employee unpacking his new printer noticed that it included an expensive internal disk drive, which no one would ever use. With all the printers the bank purchased each year, his idea to eliminate this feature saved a considerable sum of money.<br> At a Massachusetts Department of Correction facility, a guard proposed a change in the way pictures were taken of new inmates. Instead of using film, why not use digital cameras and store the images in a database? Across the department&#x2019;s sixteen correctional facilities, this idea saved $56,000 the first year in film alone.5<br> An office worker in a Florida branch of a national temporary-placement firm realized that there was a problem with her company&#x2019;s screening practices. At the time, it was paying an outside vendor to test applicants for literacy, numeracy, and computer skills. Those who passed were then given a drug test and criminal background check, which some 70 percent failed. Why not do the drug testing and criminal background check first, she asked? When the idea was implemented nationwide, the savings were huge.<br> At Winnebago Industries, the recreational vehicle maker, an assembly worker pointed out that the 10 percent of customers who ordered the deluxe sound system option were getting additional speakers they never used. No one had told the crews on the main assembly line that installed the built-in speakers for the regular sound systems to skip the vehicles that would be having the deluxe speakers installed later. The regular speakers embedded in the walls were never connected. They were seen but not heard. Although the savings from this idea were significant, the main benefit was that customers stopped bringing vehicles back to the dealers and asking them to fix speakers that were not working.<br> None of these ideas required particular insight or much creativity, or required much in the way of time or resources to implement. (In the case of Deutsche Post, oil suppliers were so eager for the business, they were willing to install the bulk tanks for free.) To the people who came up with them, they were simply common sense.<br><br> Every employee idea, no matter how small, improves an organization in some way. It is when managers are able to get large numbers of such ideas that the full power of the idea revolution is unleashed.6<br> HOW IDEAS DRIVE A CULTURE OF HIGH PERFORMANCE<br><br> There is a clear link between an organization&#x2019;s ability to tap ideas and its overall performance. Consider the following examples:<br> Boardroom Inc., a Connecticut publisher, averaged 104 ideas per employee in 2002. Its sales per employee were more than seven times greater than the average publisher.<br> Richer Sounds has been listed a number of times in the Guinness Book of World Records as having the highest sales per square foot of any retailer in the world. It also has one of the best idea systems in the United Kingdom, which brings in some twenty ideas per employee per year.<br> Milliken, a global fabric and specialty chemicals company, averaged 110 ideas per employee in 2002. In a number of its textile product lines, it competes with companies in developing nations whose prevailing wages are less than one-twentieth of those in Europe and the United States, where most Milliken operations are located. To be successful, the company has to outmanage these competitors. Over the last two decades, Milliken has actually been able to increase its advantage over them, a feat that Roger Milliken, chairman and CEO, attributes in large part to the company&#x2019;s idea system. Milliken is one of only two companies in the world that has won both the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) and the European Quality Award. The other is the French-Italian company ST Microelectronics, which has one of the better idea systems in Europe.7<br> DUBAL, a major aluminum company in the United Arab Emirates, has none of the natural advantages typically associated with aluminum producers. It must produce its own electricity, desalinate seawater from the Persian Gulf to get the large amount of fresh water it needs, and import its primary raw materials from Australia. Yet DUBAL, whose people average more than nine ideas each per year, is one of the lowest-cost producers of aluminum in the world. According to CEO John Boardman, much of the company&#x2019;s excellent performance can be credited to its idea system.<br> Dana Corporation, a global company with over sixty thousand people, expects every employee to submit two ideas each month, and in some facilities it exceeds twice this number, with a worldwide implementation rate of 80 percent. Two of the company&#x2019;s U.S. divisions have won the MBNQA.<br> In our experience, when people first encounter examples of companies like these&#x2014;work environments that are clearly so different from where they work&#x2014;they are full of questions. How do the employees in these organizations come up with so many ideas? Are the ideas any good? Who has time to deal with all of them? Don&#x2019;t you have to create a huge bureaucracy just to deal with ideas? How are employees motivated to give in so many ideas? Are they offered rewards? These are all good questions, and we will answer them in this book. But before we do, it is important to understand just how radical the concept of going after large numbers of employee ideas is. It brings about so much change, in fact, that for most managers it is revolutionary.8<br><br> Ever since Frederick Taylor first advocated that management&#x2019;s job was to think and the worker&#x2019;s job to do, this has been the default perspective. In most organizations around the world, the division between thinking and doing is &#x201c;hard-wired&#x201d; into policies, structures, and operating practices, although it is rarely explicit or even recognized for what it is. While this approach may have been the right one a hundred years ago, today it has become severely limiting. This is why the simple concept of going after employee ideas&#x2014;when done properly&#x2014;fundamentally transforms the way organizations are run, allows them to achieve levels of performance well beyond what they were previously capable of, and liberates the people working in them.<br><br> The mechanics alone of handling large quantities of ideas forces considerable change. Managers whose employees are submitting one or two ideas every week cannot hope to evaluate, test, and implement them all unless they push decision-making authority for most of them back down closer to the employees and their supervisors. This empowerment starts a virtuous cycle. As employees see their ideas being used, they begin to feel valued as part of the team and become more involved. As managers see this change in attitude and the impact that ideas have on performance, their respect for employees grows. Employees are trusted with more information, training, and authority. This in turn leads to even more and better ideas&#x2014;and the cycle continues, ultimately creating a positive, high-performance culture.<br><br> 9 <br> THE NEED FOR MANAGERIAL HUMILITY<br><br> It is easy for managers and supervisors to come to believe that they know better than the people who work for them. After all, they are usually better educated, have merited positions of greater responsibility, and earn significantly more money. They wear the &#x201c;suits.&#x201d; Managers who get large numbers of ideas from their employees have the opposite view. In our experience, they are much less arrogant. They recognize their heavy dependence on input from their subordinates. Every day, they are reminded of how valuable front-line ideas can be.<br><br> In a famous essay, Friedrich Hayek, founder of the Austrian School of Economics, articulated why employees often see problems and opportunities that their managers do not.1 In writing about decision making in organizations, Hayek divided knowledge into two types: aggregate knowledge and knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place. Managers usually deal with the first kind of knowledge&#x2014;things like &#x201c;Sales are off 10 percent&#x201d; or &#x201c;Costs went up 5 percent.&#x201d; The higher a person is in an organization, the more aggregated his or her information tends to be. While aggregate knowledge is important for understanding general relationships and formulating broad strategies, it is not very useful for coming up with specific performance-improving ideas. These come primarily from the second kind of knowledge that Hayek discussed&#x2014;the detailed knowledge of particular events, day-to-day problems and opportunities, and how things are actually done. This is exactly what employees tend to possess and why they can often come up with better ways to meet organizational goals than their managers can.10<br><br> We came across a particularly telling instance of this fact when we helped set up an idea system for one of the world&#x2019;s largest cranberry growers, a company with more than forty-five thousand acres of bogs under cultivation. At a time when cranberry prices were plummeting, management was desperate for ideas that could save money, other than ones involving more layoffs. The value of being on the spot showed in one of the very first ideas that came in. Cranberry production, like rice production, is water-intensive, and pumping large volumes of water is extremely costly. The idea, which came from a field worker, was simple: &#x201c;When it rains, turn off the sprinkler systems.&#x201d;<br> WHY ORGANIZATIONS NEVER RUN OUT OF IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES<br><br> Two questions managers often ask when they learn how well some companies are doing at getting employee ideas are &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t employees ever run out of ideas?&#x201d; and &#x201c;Can an organization get so good that there is nothing left to improve?&#x201d;<br><br> If these were real concerns, one company that would have had to deal with them is Toyota. In 1992, Yuzo Yasuda published a book about the company&#x2019;s idea system, entitled 40 Years, 20 Million Ideas. It told how Toyota got more than a million ideas per year from its employees and had been doing so for more than a decade. Around this time, a U.S. Army lieutenant general asked one of us how this could be. To him, it made no sense. Either Toyota was in very bad shape, he asserted&#x2014;so bad that it needed a million ideas per year to fix its problems&#x2014;or the whole thing was some kind of charade. Whichever was the case, Toyota&#x2019;s idea system didn&#x2019;t seem to be something other companies would want to emulate. It was a thoughtful comment from someone with considerable leadership experience. But it also exposed a degree of ignorance.11<br><br> Let us look at the two possible explanations the general proposed. First, Toyota is hardly a screwed-up organization. In fact, it is one of the most successful automakers, and one of the most adm...</p><h2>Jasper Johns: In Press: The Crosshatch Works and the Logic of Print</h2><p>Centering on &#x201c;The Dutch Wives&#x201d; (1975), a double-panel encaustic-and-newsprint painting in the artist&#x2019;s signature &#x201c;crosshatch&#x201d; motif, this catalogue explores the impact of print on the work of Jasper Johns (born 1930). The two panels of &#x201c;The Dutch Wives&#x201d; are imperfect duplicates of each other--a reminder that the process of the mechanical reproduction of words and images is never quite perfect. The book examines the concepts of &#x201c;print&#x201d; and &#x201c;the press&#x201d; in terms not only of printmaking and Johns&#x2019; celebrated experiments in that medium, but also in informational terms, tracing his frequent use of newsprint and its material, temporal, political, and formal implications. The publication also features prints and drawings by Johns that help demonstrate the aspects of printmaking that inform his entire oeuvre: repetition, reversal, indexicality, layering, sequencing and topology.</p><p></p><h2>LIKE THE SINGING COMING OFF THE DRUMS</h2><p>An erotic collection of love poems explores the many qualities of love, paints a portrait of the intensity of passion, and contains three sections, including Naked in the Streets, Shake Loose My Skin, and In This Wet Season.</p><p>Musically compelling, risky, original: yes. But the most salient characteristic of Sonia Sanchez's <i>Like the Singing Coming Off the Drums</i> is passion. There's enough erotic exuberance in these poems to make even Cupid blush, starting with the opening salvo: "you held me so close / we were like the singing coming off drums. / you made me squeeze muscles / lean back on the sound / of corpuscles sliding in blood. I heard my thighs singing." The intensity of Sanchez's love poetry can leave us breathless. Yet she is very much the public poet as well as the private one. Her collection includes tributes to such icons as Ella Fitzgerald, Tupac Amaru Shakur, Toni Cade Bambara, Cornel West, and Gwendolyn Brooks. Sanchez also produces a portrait of an HIV-positive woman, which builds to an affirmative crescendo: <blockquote> ...I ammmmmmmm<br> the universe knows that<br> I ammmmmmm<br> hiv positive but I ammm<br> still. woman. lover. mother.<br> sistah. artist. organizer. activist.<br> woman...<br> </blockquote> At her best, Sanchez bridges gender, age and race, speaking in the closest we can expect to a universal language. We read the poems in <i>Like the Singing Coming Off the Drums</i> and know exactly what she means. <i>--Martha Silano</i><b>Sonia Sanchez</b>-award-winning poet, activist, scholar, and formerly the Laura Carnell professor of English and women's studies at Temple University-is the author of sixteen books, including&nbsp;<i>Like the Singing Coming off the Drums, Does Your House Have Lions?, Wounded in the House of a Friend,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Shake Loose My Skin.</i></p><h2>Devil&#39;s Breath (Max Tudor)</h2><p><p>Even though Max's calling led him to become a vicar, his past life as a spy catches up with him . . .</p><p>Max receives the call for help when the body of glamorous film star Margot Browne is washed ashore at Monkslip-super-Mare.

Max and DCI Cotton interview the suspects as they lounge about on one of the luxury hotels dotting the waterfront.

From early pieces such as <em>East St. Louis Toodle-O</em>, <em>Black and Tan Fantasy</em>, <em>It Don't Mean a Thing</em>, and <em>Mood Indigo</em>, to his more complex works such as <em>Reminiscing in Tempo</em> and <em>Black, Brown and Beige</em>, to his later suites and sacred concerts, he left an indelible mark on the musical world. Now, in <em>The Duke Ellington Reader</em>, Mark Tucker offers the first historical anthology of writings about this major African-American musician. The volume includes over a hundred selections--interviews, critical essays, reviews, memoirs, and over a dozen writings by Ellington himself--with generous introductions and annotations for each selection provided by the editor. The result is a unique sourcebook that illuminates Ellington's work and reveals the profound impact his music has made on listeners over the years.<br> The writers gathered here represent a Who's Who of jazz criticism: Gunther Schuller, Whitney Balliett, Martin Williams, Gary Giddins, Stanley Crouch, Albert Murray, Nat Hentoff, Hugues Panassie, Stanley Dance, to name just a few. Their writings span Ellington's entire career, from the days when Duke Ellington's Washingtonians appeared at New York's Club Kentucky ("Probably the 'hottest' band this side of the equator"), to the Duke's glorious reign at the Cotton Club, to his later years as global ambassador of American music. Tucker has included some of the classic essays written about Ellington, such as R. D. Darrell's "Black Beauty," the first significant critical essay on Ellington's work and still one of the most important; Richard O. Boyer's lengthy <em>New Yorker</em> profile "The Hot Bach," printed here in its entirety; and Martin Williams's "Form Beyond Form," one of the best capsule introductions to Ellington's art. Throughout the book, the reader receives a balanced overview of Ellington's life as composer and performer, as public personality and private individual. Tucker provides a number of pieces on Ellington's compositions, including an entire chapter devoted to critical response to Ellington's <em>Black, Brown and Beige</em>, and there are also many moving pieces on Ellington the man, such as Ralph Ellison's tribute to Ellington on his 70th birthday, and Stanley Dance's funeral address. Finally, Tucker rounds out the collection with profiles on many of the outstanding musicians who worked with Ellington, among them Johnny Hodges, Bubber Miley, Billy Strayhorn, Ivie Anderson, Sonny Greer, Joe "Tricky Sam" Nanton, and Ben Webster.<br> This is a landmark volume in jazz criticism, a kaleidoscopic portrait of Duke Ellington's creative world, documenting his extraordinary achievements as composer, songwriter, bandleader, and pianist. It is an essential companion for Ellington enthusiasts, jazz fans, and serious students of American music.</p><p>This superb anthology covers the entire length of the composer's career, from his landfall in Manhattan in 1923 to the Old Master period of the early 1970s. There are dozens of reviews, essays, appreciations, and memoirs, written not only by music critics but by such heavy hitters as Ralph Ellison, Simone de Beauvoir(!), and Blaise Cendrars. The book also includes a selection of Ellington's own dicta--be sure not to overlook his 1937 polemic from "Down Beat": "Ellington Refutes Cry That Swing Started Sex Crimes!" Superbly edited and endlessly intriguing, the <i>Reader</i> is an essential volume for Ellington nuts and neophytes alike.<br><em>About the Editor:</em><br><strong>Mark Tucker</strong>, author of <em>Ellington: The Early Years</em>, is Associate Professor of Music at Columbia University.<br></p><h2>Miss Marple&#39;s Final Cases</h2><p>A collection of Miss Marple mysteries, plus some bonus short stories!

Just when it looks as though Walter's paws may never touch ground again, he encounters a flock of butterflies in distress. Only Walter's warm wind can save them from an icy death.</p><p>Walter makes his third appearance in yet another unapologetically silly picture book, this one dedicated to "everyone who's ever felt misjudged or misunderstood." The story begins when animal gas expert Professor Kompressor pays a visit to Walter's family, equipped with a contraption that looks like a cross between a vacuum cleaner and an old phonograph: "I understand your dog has a farting disorder," he says. At first it seems as if the professor's prescription of powders and potions is working, but one day, young Billy and Betty see Walter floating like a helium balloon over the trees, so full of pent-up gas he has become airborne. Unable to release his gas, the unfortunate dog floats over hill and dale for days and days. The formula for these books requires the much-maligned Walter to redeem his gaseous self by saving the day (he gasses out burglars in the first one and helps catch bank robbers in the second). Here, even more absurdly, he saves millions of butterflies from a freezing windstorm by letting rip a warm cloud of air that melts the frost off their wings. Colorful, crisp, almost three-dimensional art, generated with a digital painting and collage technique, gives the book a bizarre, sophisticated style that both complements and elevates the cheap laughs.

With the line between England and Scotland shifting daily, the Earl of Douglas wants to win back every inch of Scotland that the English have claimed; whereas the equally powerful English Percies (under Hotspur) want to win back the land between Northumberland and Edinburgh; and the Murray family is caught in the middle, shifting its alliances to try to survive. Uncertain whether she is English or Scottish and abruptly married to Sir William who is staunchly loyal to the cause of Scottish independence but who also has promised he&#39;ll never take up arms against her family, Meg Murray learns two things: first, Will&#39;s word is his bond; second, her favorite brother is spying on Douglas for Hotspur.

On a fine morning such as this the building appeared more beautiful than ever, vast and imposing, a vision of its former glory. Jasmine bloomed heady and sweet in the courtyards, its scent wafting through open doorways on a summer breeze. Gray doves cooed at the windows, and shafts of light spilled onto freshly swept floors. Even the sandstone walls had been buffed, and now the buttresses and buildings of the castle gleamed atop their rock in the pale Edinburgh sun.<br> <br>All of this had been done at the command of the last Illyri governor of the islands of Britain and Ireland, Lord Danis.<br> <br>It was blissfully quiet, also at Lord Danis&#x2019;s instruction, quieter than the old castle had been in all its long history. No soldiers bustled past, no patrol vehicles rumbled by, no airships zipped overhead, no gunfire sounded from beyond the walls, and so the lifelong comrades could continue their daily walk without interruption. It was as if the Illyri race had never been here, nor the tourists that once thronged the cobbled courtyards, nor the medieval kings, Jacobite rebels, and Celtic fighters who had preceded them. Perhaps even the long-ago footfalls of the English conquerors had never worn slow pathways into the flagstone floors. Here, in the company of Captain Peris, his long-standing companion, Lord Danis hoped to find a little peace.<br> <br>The pair moved gradually toward the main castle entrance, tracing the routes they&#x2019;d known for so long yet meeting nobody they recognized&#x2014;in fact, seeing nobody at all. They were alone in the castle. At the gateway they stood beneath the Latin script carved above the archway.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nemo me impune lacessit,&#x201d; Danis read, and there was mockery in his voice.<br> <br>He always stopped and considered the words at this point on their regular walks. Sometimes he made no comment; sometimes he shrugged; sometimes he shook his head; sometimes he swore. On more that one occasion he had broken down and wept, though that had not happened for some time now. Perhaps his heart was finally mending, thought Peris. Or hardening.<br> <br>&#x201c;No one who harms me will go unpunished,&#x201d; translated Peris, as he always did.<br> <br>&#x201c;It would be better if it read &#x2018;No good deed will go unpunished,&#x2019; &#x201d; said Danis, and after a moment he sighed. &#x201c;I should never have let them go, Peris.&#x201d;<br> <br>Peris managed a weak smile. &#x201c;You must miss her terribly,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Miss whom?&#x201d; said Danis, and he jabbed angrily at a button on the wall. Immediately the hologram of the castle disappeared and they were once again standing beside a window overlooking a nighttime garden, where milky evening moths supped from heavy, stinking blossoms. Dual moons shone brightly in the sky above, illuminating the high wall that enclosed the grounds of their gracious residence.<br> <br>Their gracious prison.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why, the Lady Fian, of course,&#x201d; said Peris. &#x201c;Your wife. You miss your wife.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, of course,&#x201d; came the governor&#x2019;s reply. He had been forced to abandon Fian on Earth during the last panicked exodus from the planet, and it was assumed that she was dead. He lived with his guilt, but only barely.<br> <br>Danis laughed, but it was a hard, clattering sound. &#x201c;For a moment I thought you meant my darling daughter,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you miss Ani too, naturally,&#x201d; agreed Peris.<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Danis spat the denial out like a piece of bad meat. &#x201c;Not my daughter. Never her. Ani is no longer blood to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Peris opened his mouth to protest, but Danis had turned to leave, and his back was as solid, his heart as impenetrable, as the walls surrounding the lush garden. The stooped Illyri muttered to himself as he went, declaring that he had had quite enough for today, that he was fantasizing about his bed, and as the governor shuffled away the security bracelet on his ankle flashed once, transmitting details of his movements to those who watched them, night and day.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Alone but not tired&#x2014;for how could one be tired after a virtual stroll around a nonexistent castle, around buildings that had long since been reduced to rubble and ash?&#x2014;Peris stared out into the silver-lined darkness. In truth, he wasn&#x2019;t sure what to think about Ani, or what to believe.<br> <br>As far as Danis was concerned, his daughter had betrayed them all. She was a true Nairene, turning her back on family and friends in favor of the red witches. She had stood by while her own father was locked up, leaving her mother forsaken on an alien world, and Danis refused to believe her claims that his imprisonment was necessary for his own protection. His only child, whom he had once loved so much&#x2014;and still did, deep in his soldier&#x2019;s heart&#x2014;was dead to him.<br> <br>Yet Ani was nearly twenty-one now, and in terms of the planet where she had been born, according to the traditions of Earth, she would soon come of age. However, Peris suspected that Ani had grown up much earlier than that, four years earlier in fact, on the day of the teenage killings on Erebos.<br> <br>The day that started the civil war.<br> <br>He remembered it as if it was yesterday, but sometimes he wondered if he truly remembered it at all. Could he really trust his own recollection when, at the time, the flesh on his arm was being eaten away as if by virulent, ravenous bacteria, apparently at the instigation of a teenage girl, a mere novice of the Nairene Sisterhood? He wouldn&#x2019;t have believed it himself if those around him hadn&#x2019;t been dying too, by fire, or in fountains of blood, or with their bones inexplicably fractured by invisible, violent hands, the audible snapping a soundtrack to their agonies.<br> <br>And then Syl Hellais&#x2014;the daughter of Peris&#x2019;s old master, Lord Andrus&#x2014;had intervened, a tornado of fury turning all the destructive forces in the room back on their makers, and there had been more suffering, more death, and the bodies had piled up around him, so many young, broken bodies. Ani had arrived too, and words were exchanged between the two friends, harsh words that could not be unsaid, and a lifelong friendship had crumpled as if it were nothing.<br> <br>Still, Syl had left, and Ani had stayed. Like a silver-haired angel, she&#x2019;d remained by Peris&#x2019;s side, holding his hand, until the Archmage Syrene had appeared.<br> <br>What had happened in all the years since now seemed inevitable&#x2014;that much Peris had come to understand. Yet still, he clung to the words Ani had uttered before Syl had fled, for they seemed to be the only hope left for his fractured, war-torn people.<br> <br>&#x201c;You seem determined to forget that the Sisterhood was founded with a noble purpose,&#x201d; Ani had told Syl, &#x201c;but I shall make it my mission to reclaim that purpose, however long it takes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>Peris had tried to explain all this to Lord Danis, but he would hear none of it.<br> <br>As for Paul, Syl, and those who had fought alongside them, they were surely dead, because nothing that entered the Derith wormhole ever emerged from it again. Peris just hoped their deaths had been clean, and quick. Sometimes a quick death was all that one could hope for. But perhaps they were all beyond hope itself now, even those still left alive.<br> <br>What they really needed was a miracle.</p><h2>Raccoons and Ripe Corn</h2><p><p>The corn is ripe...and the raccoons are hungry. As the moon rises a mother raccoon and her two young begin an all night feast in a cornfield.

Gordon Award and the <i>Washington Post</i>/Children's Book Guild Award for nonfiction. Many of his over fifty-five books have been chosen as ALA Notable Books by the American Library Association, including <i>Drawing from Nature,</i> a Christopher Award-winner.</p><p>The acclaimed artist and naturalist was inspired at an early age by the work of the American naturalists John Burroughs and Ernest Thompson Seton. For many years he concentrated on showing readers close-up pictures of the natural wonders found around his home in northern Vermont, where he and his wife, Deanna, raised their daughters, Michele and Amber.</p><p>Now, with both daughters married, Jim and Deanna have taken to exploring for wildlife in different parts of the United States. <i>Wild and Swampy</i> reflects their fascination with Southern swamplands and the creatures that live there.</p>On an autumn night, nature sends dry, yellow leaves and raccoons from a tree near the farm to the cornfield. The corn is ripe and the raccoons feast on the sweet kernels. The night passes, and the moon, an owl and the raccoons retreat before sunrise. Green husks, bare ears and half-eaten corn are left scattered among the fallen leaves. Arnosky's photograph-like depiction of nature allows the smallest of life-forms and the largest of natural phenomena to participate in one uniform processearth and sky, autumn winds and nocturnal animals, hunger and eating are all parts of nature's weaving. Fall colors of brown and yellow take on a softened, pastel look in the realistic night setting, and accurate details (the moonlight reflected in raccoon eyes) give readers a good picture of one night's occurrence. But a question remains: Can a stalk of corn really support a small but weighty-looking owl?

It therefore stands as the definitive portrait of Richter's colossal accomplishment to date. Alongside his celebrated abstractions, early black-and-white paintings and the photorealist depictions of candles, skulls and clouds that have become indisputable icons of modern painting, <i>Panorama</i> includes nearly 30 new paintings made over the past ten years, extensive comparative works, studio photographs, archival images and a substantial interview with the artist conducted by Nicholas Serota. This landmark publication is a fitting tribute to one of the world's most celebrated living artists. <br>Born in Dresden, East Germany, in 1932, <b>Gerhard Richter</b> migrated to West Germany in 1961, settling in D�sseldorf, where he studied at the D�sseldorf Academy, and where he held his first solo exhibition in 1963. Over the course of that decade, Richter helped to liberate painting from the legacy of Socialist Realism (in Eastern Germany) and Abstract Expressionism (in Western Germany and throughout Europe). He has exhibited internationally for the last five decades, with retrospectives in New York, Paris and D�sseldorf.

In 1997, the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad poisoned Hamas leader Khalid Mishal in broad daylight on the streets of Amman, Jordan. As the little-known Palestinian leader slipped into a coma, the Mossad agents&#x2019; escape was bungled and the episode quickly spiraled into a diplomatic crisis. A series of high-stakes negotiations followed, which ultimately saved Mishal and set the stage for his phenomenal political ascendancy.</p><p>In <i>Kill Khalid</i>, acclaimed reporter Paul McGeough reconstructs the history of Hamas through exclusive interviews with key players across the Middle East and in Washington, including unprecedented access to Mishal himself, who remains to this day one of the most powerful and enigmatic figures in the region.

He lives in McLean, Virginia.<br>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by GREG MYRE Actuarial tables are not kind to the leaders of Hamas. The Israeli security forces reserve a special fury for the radical Islamic group, and it's tough to be taken seriously as a Hamas leader unless you can prove that the Israelis tried to kill you at least once. The group's most notorious bomb maker was killed by an exploding cellphone in 1996. Its quadriplegic founder, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was in his wheelchair on his way home from a mosque when an Israeli missile struck him down in 2004. This past New Year's Day, a one-ton Israeli bomb flattened the apartment building that housed Hamas firebrand Nizar Rayyan, killing him, all four of his wives and 11 of their children. Given this history, Khalid Mishal, a key figure in Hamas since the group was founded two decades ago, can consider himself very lucky indeed. His brush with death came on the streets of Amman, Jordan, in 1997, when an Israeli Mossad agent squirted an exotic poison in his ear. But the would-be assassin and an accomplice were quickly chased down by Mishal's driver, his bodyguard and some passersby. Outraged that the attack took place on Jordanian soil, King Hussein demanded the antidote from Israel as part of the price for releasing the Mossad agents. Under U.S. pressure, the Israelis reluctantly complied. This episode made Mishal an instant legend within Hamas. He became a martyr in a group that reveres them and did so without the inconvenience of dying. In "Kill Khalid," Australian journalist Paul McGeough uses the botched assassination as the jumping-off point for a timely and thorough examination of Hamas, highlighting the ways in which Israel has intentionally and unintentionally aided its rise. Mishal's near-death experience has been well reported in previous books and articles, and this book runs the risk of being as stale as month-old hummus. But in the circular nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the same characters keep coming back around, and this 12-year-old drama couldn't be more relevant today. Binyamin Netanyahu was the Israeli prime minister who authorized the attempt on Mishal's life. It proved to be a huge embarrassment, and though Hamas wasn't part of the negotiations, the reckless Israeli action was one of a thousand cuts that drained the blood out of the peace process that had begun so hopefully with the 1993 Oslo accords. So what's new? Well, Netanyahu's Likud party finished a close second in Israel's February elections, and he has been trying to form a coalition government with himself as prime minister. If he succeeds, his most immediate security concern will be Hamas . . . led by Khalid Mishal. Back in 1997, President Bill Clinton intervened to calm the Jordanians and contain the political damage from the attempted assassination. This past week, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton toured the region and met with Netanyahu in hopes of restarting negotiations. The cast may be familiar, but one huge difference between then and now is that Hamas is much more powerful, which will greatly complicate any peace effort. McGeough documents how, two decades ago, Israel encouraged the development of Hamas by allowing it to establish schools, health clinics and other social services. Israel's thinking at the time was that Hamas could serve as a religious counterweight to Yasser Arafat's secular Fatah movement and splinter Palestinian loyalties. But once it put down roots, Hamas quickly expanded its role, moving from peace-process spoiler in the 1990s, to suicide-bombing assembly line at the beginning of this decade, to rulers of the ravaged Gaza Strip for the past three years. For such a key figure, Mishal is not well known, even to Palestinians. He was just 11 when his family fled the West Bank in the wake of the 1967 war, and he last set foot there in 1975. After bouncing around the Middle East, he now maintains a relatively low profile in Damascus, where he lives in a guarded compound reserved mostly for Syrian VIPs and foreign diplomats. Yet as much as anyone else in the region today, Mishal is linked to all the key players. He tends to surface at vital moments -- such as Israel's assault on Gaza in December and January -- and McGeough makes excellent use of him to explain the cross-currents that make the Middle East so messy. To begin with, Mishal must negotiate the friction between Hamas "insiders," the leaders based in Gaza, and the group's "outsiders," exiles such as himself. He also figures prominently in the tensions that pit Hamas against Fatah. He is a full-throated advocate of suicide bombings who issued predictably hard-line statements during the recent fighting in Gaza. Yet on those occasions when Hamas turns to diplomacy, Mishal pops up in Egypt or Saudi Arabia to guide the Hamas delegation. He depends on Syria for his security and has links in Lebanon to Hezbollah, a group Hamas has long studied and emulated. Mishal is also on good terms with Hamas's most important patron, Iran, which supplies cash and trains Hamas militants. In short, it's hard to figure out the Mideast jigsaw puzzle without understanding where he fits in. As a reporter, I covered Hamas for years, and it was always tricky gauging Mishal's influence. His exhortations to strike at Israel certainly resonated with the radical youths in Gaza, yet at times it seemed that his perch in exile left him out of day-to-day decision-making by Hamas leaders on the ground. But Israel has systematically killed many of those leaders, and Mishal's prominence has grown by process of elimination. McGeough makes a strong case that, even from afar, Mishal is deeply involved in daily events in Gaza. The author was with Mishal in his Damascus compound in September 2007, when Al-Jazeera was broadcasting scenes of Hamas security forces beating Fatah protesters in Gaza. An exasperated Mishal spoke by phone to the Hamas security chief in Gaza and told him to ease up. Far too many earnest, lumbering books on the Middle East propose recycled versions of the path to peace. McGeough doesn't offer a solution to the conflict. But he provides a highly instructive account of how Hamas emerged as a potent force and why its faithful honor Mishal as the "martyr who did not die." <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Now, as attorney Gloria Dalton, she has just taken over the practice of the newly deceased Deke Black in Mojo, Louisiana, and found a voodoo doll as a welcoming gift.

Each person who possesses Annabelle falls into horrible circumstances, and Annabelle isn't sure if she's merely witnessing the horror or causing it. </li></ul></p><p>Here are five stories of girls and women viewed through the eyes of their rag doll, Annabelle. Some are variations on more familiar tales. Little Red Riding Hood's wolf is transformed into a romantic hero who saves a girl from abusive parents, and "Beauty and the Beast" becomes the story of the forbidden love between two women. Elsewhere, we meet Paige, a 1920s flapper who falls in love with a ghostly stranger, and Catherine, who is driven insane by the ghost of her husband's first wife. Valentino's storytelling has a lilting gothic tone, and her heroines are beautiful and fragile. FSc's art is a delicate take on the Ameri-manga style, in which he balances cute with a sort of impressionism to keep the appropriate mood. A spooky recommendation for goth-subculture readers, especially. <i>Tina Coleman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The wait is over with the first volume of <i>Inu-Yasha</i>. The story begins in Feudal Japan (technically, the Warring States period of the Muromachi era) where a mythical creature named Inu-Yasha, half dog and half boy, pillages a small town in search of a magical jewel. He is stopped by the village priestess who takes the jewel with her to the afterlife. Cut to modern times where Kagome (a splitting image of the village priestess) finds herself lost in a time portal and runs into Inu-Yasha himself. Her reaction is priceless: "Is he a demon or a junior high school kid?" This is the magic of Rumiko Takahashi--she has woven an intriguing historical fantasy that is filled with horror, humor, and romance in a way that most people would not think possible. <i>--Jim Pascoe</i></p><h2>The Encyclopedia of Energy Medicine</h2><p>ustomer Reviews 5.0 out of 5 stars (6) 5.0 out of 5 stars 5 star 6 4 star 0 3 star 0 2 star 0 1 star 0 See all 6 customer reviews Share your thoughts with other customers Most Helpful Customer Reviews 7 of 7 people found the following review helpful 5.0 out of 5 stars Energy Medicine in Abundance April 5, 2010 By Theodore L.

Since that time, Guy's influence has become more widely acknowledged, and his fortunes have certainly increased with his growing reputation. <i>Damn Right I've Got the Blues</i> is laudatory yet frank in discussing Guy's accomplishments as well as his troubles. From an evolutionary standpoint, Guy is a historic link between such electric blues pioneers as Howlin' Wolf and much later revivalists like Stevie Ray Vaughan. Guy's use of feedback had a profound influence on several rock musicians, especially Jimi Hendrix. Through interviews with the man himself, other musicians, and other figures in the music industry, Wilcock makes clear this and Guy's other achievements and also the vicissitudes of Guy's lifelong journey from Louisiana poverty through Chicago's blues bars to his current fame. An abundance of photographs and a thorough discography add to the book's value to blues aficionados. <i>Aaron Cohen</i>Guy is the link between Chicago blues pioneers Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters and English musicians like Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page who made millions exposing blues music to the world. For 35 years, Guy played with luminaries from the worlds of rock and blues, but despite releasing albums on at least ten labels, he remained only a musician's favorite. It was not until 1992, at the age of 55, that he had a significant hit of his own: the Grammy Award-winning "Damn Right I've Got the Blues." Guy has had a huge influence on guitarists as notable as Hendrix and Vaughn. Muddy Waters passed the torch to Buddy shortly before his death when he said, "Don't let them goddam blues die on me." Guy has kept that promise by passing on reverence to the blues to the next generation. Essential for all popular music collections.<br><i>- Dan Bogey, Clearfield Cty. P.L.

The Rumble. The Revolution.</h2><p><b><b>#1&nbsp;<i>NEW YORK TIMES</i>&nbsp;BESTSELLER � When we deny our stories, they define us. When we own our stories, we get to write the ending.</b> <br></b><br> Social scientist Bren� Brown has ignited a global conversation on courage, vulnerability, shame, and worthiness. Her pioneering work uncovered a profound truth: Vulnerability&#x2014;the willingness to show up and be seen with no guarantee of outcome&#x2014;is the only path to more love, belonging, creativity, and joy. But living a brave life is not always easy: We are, inevitably, going to stumble and fall.<br><br> It is the rise from falling that Brown takes as her subject in <i>Rising Strong</i>. As a grounded theory researcher, Brown has listened as a range of people&#x2014;from leaders in Fortune 500 companies and the military to artists, couples in long-term relationships, teachers, and parents&#x2014;shared their stories of being brave, falling, and getting back up. She asked herself, <i>What do these people with strong and loving relationships, leaders nurturing creativity, artists pushing innovation, and clergy walking with people through faith and mystery have in common?</i> The answer was clear: They recognize the power of emotion and they&#x2019;re not afraid to lean in to discomfort.<br><br> Walking into our stories of hurt can feel dangerous. But the process of regaining our footing in the midst of struggle is where our courage is tested and our values are forged. Our stories of struggle can be big ones, like the loss of a job or the end of a relationship, or smaller ones, like a conflict with a friend or colleague. Regardless of magnitude or circumstance, the rising strong process is the same: We <i>reckon </i>with our emotions and get curious about what we&#x2019;re feeling; we <i>rumble </i>with our stories until we get to a place of truth; and we live this process, every day, until it becomes a practice and creates nothing short of a <i>revolution</i> in our lives. Rising strong after a fall is how we cultivate wholeheartedness. It&#x2019;s the process, Brown writes, that teaches us the most about who we are.<br><br><b>ONE OF <i>GREATER GOOD</i>&#x2019;S FAVORITE BOOKS OF THE YEAR<br><br>Praise for <i>Rising Strong</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Bren� Brown&#x2019;s] research and work have given us a new vocabulary, a way to talk with each other about the ideas and feelings and fears we&#x2019;ve all had but haven&#x2019;t quite known how to articulate. . . . Bren� empowers us each to be a little more courageous.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2014;The Huffington Post</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;With a fresh perspective that marries research and humor, Brown offers compassion while delivering thought-provoking ideas about relationships&#x2014;with others and with oneself.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of August 2015:</strong> You may be someone who looks at <em>Rising Strong</em> and says, &#x201c;oh, that&#x2019;s not really for me....&#x201d; Translation: I don&#x2019;t read or need that self-help stuff, give me a good novel and go away. But Bren� Brown isn&#x2019;t a spiritual guru, or someone who&#x2019;s risen from the ashes to tell us how to live our lives. She&#x2019;s a researcher. And <em>Rising Strong</em> isn&#x2019;t some feel-good-get-over-it regimen; it&#x2019;s more investigative reporting on the common denominators of people who whole-heartedly get back up and go another round after getting their asses handed to them in big and small ways. In her straightforward Texan voice, Brown sets the table for us to get curious about life&#x2019;s sticky moments and invites us to serve ourselves a plate of what she&#x2019;s learned in over a decade of research. I don&#x2019;t know about you, but I&#x2019;m not trying to be famous or come up with a cure that will change the world, I just want to live happily and keep getting back in the arena whether I&#x2019;ve been rocked on my heels, knocked to my knees, or gone face down in the dirt. For my money, seeing how I can do that better is worth reading about. <em>&#x2013; Seira Wilson</em></p><b>Dr. Bren� Brown, PhD, LMSW,&nbsp;</b>is a research professor at the University of Houston where she holds the Huffington Foundation-Bren� Brown Endowed Chair at The Graduate College of Social Work.<br>&nbsp;<br>She has spent the past sixteen years studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy and is the author of three #1 New York Times bestsellers &#x2013;&nbsp;<i>The Gifts of Imperfection</i>,&nbsp;<i>Daring Greatly</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Rising Strong</i>.

He had a BlackBerry, an iPad, an iPod, and a third-generation Kindle.<br><br>He had a pain, mild but constant, a fluttery twinge in the soft tissue just above his left eye, deep in the hollow where you&#x2019;d put your thumb if you were going to try lifting him by his cranium. Sometimes late at night, in his tiny apartment in a grimly forgotten, perpetually unfashionable corner of Lower Manhattan, he would find himself Googling: twinge, eye, flutter. Or: thumb, skull.<br><br>When it occurred to him what that last pair rhymed with&#x2014; numbskull&#x2014;he stopped Googling it. But he couldn&#x2019;t forget.<br><br>Each weekday, Harold took the subway to his job at a video store a few blocks from Ground Zero, a place with a sale bin out front and a sputtery neon sign in the grimy window. Once it had thrived, but the only videos people rented nowadays were ones they wouldn&#x2019;t dare view on the Internet for fear of prison time.<br><br>The films didn&#x2019;t have brightly illustrated cardboard sleeves, or even titles. Furtive men&#x2014;no women, in Harold&#x2019;s depressingly extensive experience&#x2014;entered the store with money in hand, and asked without looking up at Harold for number 19, or number 204.<br><br>Harold wondered if they were ashamed of themselves, or if maybe they just didn&#x2019;t like seeing his eye twitch. If maybe they were creeped out by him. What he didn&#x2019;t wonder was what kind of unspeakably sordid images the videos contained; he needed the job too much for that.<br><br>But after three years in the store&#x2014;the sputtering neon sign, the nagging eye pain, the worn black plastic cassettes or clear jewel cases that he wiped thoroughly with spray cleaner anytime one of them got returned&#x2014;he also needed a vacation. So when the store&#x2019;s owner laid Harold off for two weeks due to cash-flow problems, he decided to go to Maine.<br><br>He&#x2019;d never been, just seen pictures of the place. Probably Maine colors weren&#x2019;t as bright as they looked in the pages of magazines, with lighthouses as red-and-white-striped as new candy canes, and water as blue as&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, nothing in this life was ever really that blue, Harold felt sure.<br><br>But it didn&#x2019;t matter what it was like there. It was the idea of Maine that attracted him: clean air, not too many people. Forests you could walk into and not find your way out again, mineral-clear lakes, numbingly cold, where you could wade in and dissolve with a sigh, like a fizzy lozenge.<br><br>Not that he meant to; wade into one of those lakes, that is, and never wade out. But the idea of such wilderness&#x2014;of surfaces that hadn&#x2019;t been handled and breathed on, or even looked at, by millions of people&#x2014;spoke deeply to him, somehow, even though he had never experienced any such place himself.<br><br>So Harold left all his electronic gadgets at home and took a bus from Port Authority to Bangor, Maine, then a smaller one whose seats were made of hard plastic. As they wound out of Bangor, the driver drank Diet Coke and blared Top Forty on the radio propped up on the cluttered dashboard while the bus juddered along the twisty, crumbling two-lane blacktop.<br><br>Hours passed while Harold stared out the window at a world growing steadily more rural and less like anything he&#x2019;d ever seen before: small wooden houses with garishly colored plastic toys in their rough yards, lobster traps stacked along unpaved driveways, boats sagging on trailers. Next came lengthy stretches where it seemed no one at all lived, the unfenced fields high and boulder-studded and the forests appearing darkly impenetrable.<br><br>At last they reached a small, desolate-looking intersection marked by an out-of-business gas station and convenience store. No sign, but the driver said it was the right place; hoisting his backpack, Harold got out and the bus trundled away, leaving him alone on the gravel shoulder, which was littered with hundreds of old and new filtered cigarette butts.<br><br>All around him loomed giant evergreens, their pointed tops etched on a fiercely blue sky. A big white-headed bird&#x2014;a bald eagle, Harold realized; he&#x2019;d never seen one of those before, either&#x2014;sailed above.<br><br>The roar of a diesel engine shattered the silence as a log truck loaded with forty-foot tree trunks hurtled past, the smell of fresh pine sap sharp in its wake. Watching it go, he felt a sudden, drowning sense of isolation and loss, as if his old life had been torn away and had yet to be replaced by anything.<br><br>If it would be. Abruptly, he wished he hadn&#x2019;t come. Back in the city, he was always so surrounded and assaulted by crowds and clamor, it was easy there to pretend that he wasn&#x2019;t alone.<br><br>Here it was different. Turning, he heard the gravel crunch loudly beneath his feet. A big dog barked, somewhere on the other side of a line of trees. From the rotting eaves of the boarded-up convenience store, wasps drifted, each one materializing in the gloom at the nest&#x2019;s entrance, then launching itself.<br><br>Harold wondered suddenly what it was like in that nest, in the insectile dark. But he didn&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;d better try to find out. Just then a car pulled up to where the gas pumps used to be.<br><br>&#x201c;You waitin&#x2019; for a ride?&#x201d; The car was an old, dark blue Monte Carlo with the word taxi inexpertly stenciled on it in white.<br><br>The driver, a large, whiskery man wearing a fedora, chewed a cigar stub. Harold did not recall any cabdriver back in the city ever waiting so patiently or looking at him so frankly, as if genuinely engaged in this interaction and curious about Harold&#x2019;s reply.<br><br>Harold hefted his backpack, which he had let down onto the cracked concrete pad that the absent gas pumps had once stood on. Ten minutes later, after crossing a causeway and traversing some of the most astonishingly beautiful geography he&#x2019;d ever seen&#x2014;trees, a long beach with legions of small birds striding stick-legged on it, a wide expanse of water, then more trees and water again&#x2014;he reached the island city of Eastport, Maine.<br><br>&#x201c;Here you go. That&#x2019;ll be seven bucks. A buck a mile,&#x201d; the taxi man explained around the cigar stub.<br><br>Harold blinked, still stunned by the beauty and variety of the fields, forested land, and reedy marshes he&#x2019;d been whisked through, the ponds, pools, and tidal inlets he&#x2019;d passed over.<br><br>Chomping the cigar, the driver eyed him wisely. &#x201c;City boy, eh? Don&#x2019;t worry. You stay here, you&#x2019;ll get over it. Eventually,&#x201d; he added with a wink, taking the ten Harold handed him.<br><br>&#x201c;Keep the change,&#x201d; said Harold. The Monte pulled away in a belch of gray exhaust fumes that the breeze, smelling strongly of salt water and creosote, snatched up and dispersed.<br><br>Leaving him alone, again, though here at least there were people going about their business: into the hardware store, the pizza shop, and the T-shirt-and-souvenir store all located in the three-story red-brick buildings directly before him. To his left loomed another brick edifice, an old bank now repurposed into an art gallery, with a fountain and a small terrace in front of it. There was an ornate metal park bench placed on the terrace, which he thought was a nice touch.<br><br>Right behind him was an old-fashioned diner. Through a small screened front window, he saw a long Formica counter and a series of red leatherette booths, and suddenly realized he was starving. He&#x2019;d been on the road almost two days with only snacks and small bottles of juice to eat and drink, from the vending machines in various bus stations.<br><br>Turning to enter the diner, he got his first view of the bay, which even after all of the water he&#x2019;d already crossed he hadn&#x2019;t realized was so very near. Seeing it on a map had been one thing, the letters printed over it spelling out Passamaquoddy Bay, which he guessed must be a Native American name. But being right next to it was another, especially since thing, there was no one on it.<br><br>Or almost no one; dark blue with flocks of gulls hovering over it, the bay was narrow and extended a long way to his left and right, which he recalled from the map were north and south. A few fish- ing boats puttered, their wakes boiling white, engines puffing up clouds of diesel. The bay itself looked serene, though, not like the busy, �commerce-clogged waterways at home.<br><br>He gazed for another moment, inhaling the salty air. But more delay than that, the pangs of his appetite would not allow. A whiff of grilled bacon drifted sweetly out of the diner&#x2019;s screen window, seized him by the nose, and drew him hungrily in.<br><br>Half an hour later he was sopping up the last bit of egg yolk with his last corner of buttered toast. The waitress was so free with the coffee refills, he thought she&#x2019;d have left the pot if he&#x2019;d asked. He washed the delicious mouthful down with a sip from his freshly topped-up cup and, sighing, leaned back.<br><br>He&#x2019;d made it. He&#x2019;d gotten here, all the long way to Maine&#x2019;s downeast coast, so far from the island of Manhattan and, as he had already begun realizing, so utterly different from it.<br><br>And he felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fine. Scared, a little, and still not sure how he was getting away with such an adventurous, such a previously unthought-of, expedition. He didn&#x2019;t quite trust his success yet, he guessed. But so far, so good.<br><br>Two men slid onto stools at the counter. They were in their sixties, maybe, Harold thought from their work-bent postures, and they were similarly dressed in jeans, boots, and faded plaid shirts, with Red Sox ball caps on their heads. When they spoke, continuing a conversation that had evidently begun outside, their accents amazed Harold.<br><br>&#x201c;Pretty fah from heah.&#x201d; The first man stirred sugar i...</p><h2>For Adam&#39;s Sake: A Family Saga in Colonial New England</h2><p><p><strong>Winner of the New England Historical Association&#x2019;s James P. Hanlan Book Award<br> Winner the Association for the Study of Connecticut History&#x2019;s Homer D. Babbidge Jr. Award</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;Incomparably vivid . . . as enthralling a portrait of family life [in colonial New England] as we are likely to have.&#x201d;&#x2015;<em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong></p> In the tradition of Laurel Thatcher Ulrich&#x2019;s classic, <em>A Midwife&#x2019;s Tale</em>, comes this groundbreaking narrative by one of America&#x2019;s most promising colonial historians. Joshua Hempstead was a well-respected farmer and tradesman in New London, Connecticut. As his remarkable diary&#x2015;kept from 1711 until 1758&#x2015;reveals, he was also a slave owner who owned Adam Jackson for over thirty years. In this engrossing narrative of family life and the slave experience in the colonial North, Allegra di Bonaventura describes the complexity of this master/slave relationship and traces the intertwining stories of two families until the eve of the Revolution. Slavery is often left out of our collective memory of New England&#x2019;s history, but it was hugely impactful on the central unit of colonial life: the family. In every corner, the lines between slavery and freedom were blurred as families across the social spectrum fought to survive. In this enlightening study, a new portrait of an era emerges. 16 pages of illustrations; 2 maps</p><p>Allegra di Bonaventura is the associate director of graduate programs at Yale Law School.

Closely examining the dynamics of the doctor&#x2013;patient exchange, he seeks to locate and describe the elusive therapeutic environment within which psychological healing most effectively takes place.</p><p>In a world that seems&nbsp;increasingly&nbsp;complex, even hostile, many of us yearn for a place where we can be totally accepted, where grievances great and small can be aired, old hurts and secret foibles&nbsp;disclosed&nbsp;to another trusting human being. To find such a place, and such a person, could give us the safety and freedom we need to be who we really are.&nbsp; In this beautifully written, meticulously thoughtful book, psychiatrist Leston Havens declares that a safe place does exist--indeed must exist--in the therapist's office as the process of healing takes place. With great empathy for his patients, Dr. Havens takes readers into the mind of the therapist as he does his careful work: the kind of thinking he must do during sessions, how he must sometimes hold back for the patient's good, deal with his <i>own</i>&nbsp;feelings appropriately, or provoke in order to enlighten.&nbsp; As he narrates his experience with a variety of patients--a highly emotional college student, a&nbsp;physician&nbsp;preoccupied by death, a schizophrenic seminary student, and others--Dr. Havens describes the challenge of creating a safe place for people who are wary, forlorn, and sick at heart. And in his capable hands, the idea of a safe place is explored in ways that can be translated to life outside the treatment session. In doing so, he teaches all of us the quality of mind required to establish a safe place for ourselves, and for others.Leston L. Havens, M.D.&nbsp; was Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Cambridge Hospital.</p><h2>Wild Mountain Thyme</h2><p>Victoria Bradshaw fell in love with London playwright Oliver Dobbs when she was just eighteen.

The perfect read for fans of Edward Marston and LJ Ross.</strong></p><p>'It looks as if Ann Granger is on to another winner' -<i>Birmingham Post</i></p><p>Fran Varady is insolvent, unemployed and, though for the moment she's got the leaky roof of the squat she shares in Jubilee Street over her head, she'll very soon be homeless thanks to the council eviction department. Her dreams of becoming an actress, nurtured when her father and grandmother were still alive, seem a long way off. But Fran is a survivor ... which her former housemate, Terry, found hanging from the ceiling of her room, clearly is not.</p><p>Terry, secretive and selfish, was far from popular with the rest of the household, but her death shakes the Jubilee Street Creative Artists' Commune, as the squat residents half-jokingly call themselves. And, the more Fran discovers about the death of the young woman whose life briefly intersected with her own, the more she begins to see it was not all it first seemed.</p><p><strong>What readers are saying about<i>Asking for Trouble</i>:</strong></p><p>'<strong>Fran is too good to confine to one book</strong>.

As usual, everyone except her best friend, Ganesh, is skeptical about her abilities--this time to discover who killed her former housemate, Terry, found hanging from the ceiling. And as usual in Ann Granger's enjoyable British mystery series, Fran triumphs. Kim Hicks has read several of the Fran Varady series, to excellent reviews. This audiobook is not an exception. Hicks IS Fran Varady in the same way that Alec Guiness IS George Smiley. She also delivers a well-paced reading in which the other characters come alive. A convincing, entertaining performance.

So we have a neat, sweeping history of the 20th century, and about a decade beyond. The Nobel prize involves a first world war, a second world war, a cold war, a terror war, and more. It contends with many of the key issues of modern times, and of life itself.<br><br>It also presents a parade of interesting people more than a hundred laureates, not a dullard in the bunch. Some of these laureates have been historic statesmen, such as Roosevelt (Teddy) and Mandela. Some have been heroes or saints, such as Martin Luther King and Mother Teresa. Some belong in other categories where would you place Arafat? Controversies also swirl around the awards to Kissinger, Gorbachev, Gore, and Obama, to name just a handful.<br><br>Probably no figure in this book is more interesting than a non-laureate: Alfred Nobel, the Swedish scientist and entrepreneur who started the prizes. The book also addresses missing laureates,&#x201d; people who did not win the peace prize but might have, or should have (Gandhi?).<br><br><i>Peace, They Say</i> is enlightening and enriching, and sometimes even fun. It has its opinions, but it also provides what is necessary for readers to form their own opinions. What is peace, anyway?

Many people understand that their votes are unlikely to change the outcome of an election and don't see the point in learning much about politics. This creates a nation of people with little political knowledge and little ability to objectively evaluate what they <i>do</i> know.<br><br>Ilya Somin mines the depths of&nbsp; public ignorance in America and reveals it as a major challenge for democracy. He weighs various potential solutions, provocatively arguing that political ignorance is best mitigated and its effects lessened by decentralizing and limiting government. People make better decisions when they choose what to purchase in the market or which state or local government to live under, than when they vote at the ballot box, because they have stronger incentives to acquire relevant information and to use it wisely. <br><br>The second edition of <i>Democracy and Political Ignorance</i> fully updates its analysis to include new and vital discussions of the "Big Sort" and its implications for "voting with your feet," the connection between political ignorance and the disproportionate political influence of the wealthy, new proposals for increasing political knowledge, and up-to-date survey data on political ignorance from recent elections. <br><br>The first edition of this book<i> </i>attracted interest around the world, and has been translated into Italian and Japanese.</p><p>Ilya Somin is a Professor at George Mason University School of Law.

In this rich, vivid biography of the "greatest magician in the world," celebrated historian of stage magic Jim Steinmeyer captures the career and controversies of the wonder-worker extraordinaire, Howard Thurston. <br><br> The public's fickleness over magicians has left Thurston all but forgotten today. Yet Steinmeyer shows how his story is one of the most remarkable in show business. During his life, from 1869 to 1936, Thurston successfully navigated the most dramatic changes in entertainment-from street performances to sideshows to wagon tours through America's still-wild West to stage magic amid the glitter of grand theaters. <br><br> Thurston became one of America's most renowned vaudeville stars, boldly performing an act with just a handful of playing cards, and then had the foresight to leave vaudeville, expanding his show into an extravaganza with more than forty tons of apparatusand costumes. His touring production was an American institution for nearly thirty years, and Thurston earned a brand name equal to Ziegfeld or Ringling Brothers. <br><br> Steinmeyer explores the stage and psychological rivalry between Thurston and Houdini during the first decades of the twentieth century- a contest that Thurston won. He won with a bigger show, a more successful reputation, and the title of America's greatest magician. In <i>The Last Greatest Magician in the World</i>, Thurston's magic show is revealed as the one that animates our collective memories.</p><p>Jim Steinmeyer is the critically acclaimed author of <i>The Glorious Deception</i>, <i>Charles Fort</i>, and <i>Hiding the Elephant</i>, a <i>Los Angeles Times</i> bestseller.

Not on a Sunday off. Working undercover required patience, persistence, and... popcorn. He tossed a fluffy kernel into the air and caught the buttery delight in his mouth then eyed the Greek water-maiden statue.<br><br>The one he&#x2019;d been lusting over for the past hour.<br><br>More like three weeks.<br><br>He&#x2019;d staked out a lot of things in his undercover career with the BAD&#x2014;Bureau of American Defense&#x2014;agency, but never a woman for purely personal interest.<br><br>No one at the Festival of Emperors paid attention to him, probably because he&#x2019;d dressed in jeans and a gray T-shirt instead of period clothing. Roman soldiers and women in togas hustled around trying to buy up the last deals of the day. The mid-July event drew traffic from across metro Atlanta to the historic square in Marietta.<br><br>And no one strolling past the water maiden in the last hour had noticed why that one statue was different from the other three, besides being the only female sculpture.<br><br>But he did.<br><br>Beneath all that caked-on makeup beat the live heart of a flesh-and-blood woman. One he had to get an answer from before heading back to work on Tuesday.<br><br>Hell of a way to squander his last day off for a while and ancient history wasn&#x2019;t his forte, but he lived only a mile away and <i>she</i> was worth standing here waiting for the festival to end. He hoped.<br><br>A simple yes or no.<br><br>One answer had the power to... eat a hole in his gut.<br><br>Sweat trickled down his neck but he couldn&#x2019;t be as hot as that water maiden posed silently amid three massive concrete sculptures of Greek gods.<br><br>CeCe Caprice just pretended to be a statue. She could go for hours without moving a muscle when she performed.<br><br>He could attest to how hard she trained daily at his gym in Marietta. Yep, every inch of that shapely body wrapped in a toga and posed with a baby doll also coated in white plaster was very much a living, breathing human... and one hot female.<br><br>That he couldn&#x2019;t touch, damn it.<br><br>Correction. Wouldn&#x2019;t touch. Not if he found out she really had meant to give him a &#x201c;back off&#x201d; signal yesterday after spending the afternoon planting some damn flowers in her yard.<br><br>At least, that&#x2019;s how he&#x2019;d read her odd reaction when he asked her out to dinner. Now he was starting to wonder if he&#x2019;d jumped to the wrong conclusion when she hadn&#x2019;t actually said the word &#x201c;no.&#x201d;<br><br>He&#x2019;d never pressed a woman for anything so he&#x2019;d backed off. Quick. Then regretted it when he missed her for the past twenty-four hours. He&#x2019;d gotten used to sharing iced tea on her patio for the best part of three weeks, had never spent that much time just talking to a woman. The females he met were only interested in what he intended to do to their naked bodies.<br><br>But CeCe had hung on his words. And laughed at his jokes.<br><br>He hadn&#x2019;t even kissed her or had dinner with her.<br><br>Twenty-four hours of no iced tea, no talking, and no smiles. He missed her. Couldn&#x2019;t get her out of his mind for one day.<br><br>A woman had never spun him inside out like this.<br><br>Lust used to be fun, and short-lived. Not obsessive.<br><br>Three weeks at home recuperating from a leg wound&#x2014;a souvenir of his last mission&#x2014;hadn&#x2019;t turned out anything like he&#x2019;d expected. Limping to his mailbox the first day at home he&#x2019;d expected nothing more exciting than his standard fan mail from bill collectors.<br><br>When the screen door on the rental house next to his burst open and CeCe strolled down her driveway, the first thing he&#x2019;d noticed was the sweet belly button winking at him between a red half shirt and white shorts.<br><br>He&#x2019;d thought one of his teammates from BAD had sent him a get-well-soon girl. No way could that little bombshell be his honest to God next-door neighbor.<br><br>His luck had never run <i>that</i> hot.<br><br>But she was indeed a new addition to the neighborhood. For the first time since moving there he regretted having to leave as soon as he healed.<br><br>CeCe had destroyed any operating brain cells he&#x2019;d possessed the minute she smiled at him. Blue eyes had sparkled bright as sapphires tossed up in blazing sunshine. Every time she turned her head, he fought the urge to touch the wavy auburn hair that brushed her shoulders.<br><br>He woke up at night thinking about that thick mass spread across a pillow. His pillow. His bed.<br><br>But CeCe wasn&#x2019;t the kind of woman you spent a couple of steamy nights with then walked away. He&#x2019;d be the first to admit he came by women easily only because the women he met saw him as nothing more than a short-term sexual buzz. Something to hold them over until the real thing came along. He&#x2019;d accepted that for years as a trade-off for not having to spend his life entirely alone.<br><br>Hell, he wasn&#x2019;t long-term material. Not with his criminal history or his current occupation that required going back to prison on a regular basis.<br><br>And it wasn&#x2019;t like he could tell a woman he got arrested and thrown in the joint as part of his job description for BAD.<br><br>Which was why he should be looking for fast, fun, and forgettable instead of waiting to talk to CeCe here, the one place she couldn&#x2019;t disappear in her house and ignore him. He&#x2019;d tried to do the same, to forget CeCe, but he&#x2019;d spent three amazing weeks pretending he had a normal life because a sweet young woman shared iced tea and talked to him. She made him want a normal life. He just didn&#x2019;t know how to go about making it happen. Of all the women who had climbed in his bed, he&#x2019;d never desired one like he wanted CeCe, and he hadn&#x2019;t even held her in his arms. Spending time with her felt too damned good not to try again to ask her out. To try to keep her.<br><br>No mission had turned his gut inside out like this.<br><br>He officially went back to work undercover in two days. Before that happened he would know where he stood with her. Had she turned down the date because she&#x2019;d <i>really</i> had plans with her brother or because she wouldn&#x2019;t date a neighbor?<br><br>He only wanted a date. A dinner, movie... hell, he didn&#x2019;t know. Anything. Something.<br><br>But if CeCe told him no today he&#x2019;d respect her decision and walk away... then ask BAD to relocate his residence while he was gone on the next mission so he wouldn&#x2019;t have to face coming home to find another man on her patio.<br><br>Popcorn crackled inside the bag he crushed in his fist.<br><br>Damn it, he&#x2019;d never been in knots over a woman before.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, J!&#x201d; a familiar male voice yelled.<br><br>Jeremy groaned. What the hell was Blade doing here? He stepped away from the side of the gazebo he&#x2019;d been leaning against and turned to find Blade covering the fifty feet between them with long strides. Most people thought the skinny six-foot, four-inch guy got his name from having a body that moved through crowds like a black knife slicing water, not because he&#x2019;d carried a switchblade since grade school.<br><br>After being busted in a chop shop raid and doing a stint in prison, Blade returned home to start a legitimate body shop business. Rehabilitating a cat not to hunt mice would be more realistic, but he&#x2019;d been straight for a year and swore he was going to stay on this side of the law. His Denzel Washington smile, charismatic tongue, and ever present sense of humor drew women faster than bees to a hive.<br><br>Jeremy met him when they landed in the same cellblock in a Florida correctional institute after Jeremy got picked up for possession of stolen goods. BAD planted the merchandise and dropped the dime on him via a snitch so Jeremy could expose the identity of a nasty guy who had tortured and murdered three teens who refused to steal for him.<br><br>A dirty, but rewarding, job most days.<br><br>&#x201c;Whatcha doing here?&#x201d; Blade glided up in blue jeans and a red T-shirt sporting a motorcycle design. &#x201c;This ain&#x2019;t your playground, dog.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Boning up on ancient history.&#x201d; Jeremy peeked at his water maiden to make sure CeCe hadn&#x2019;t come out of her comatose state yet, but she hadn&#x2019;t so much as blinked.<br><br>&#x201c;Speaking of boners, I got something right up your alley.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what I said.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re thinkin&#x2019; about.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do you figure that?&#x201d; Jeremy crossed his arms.<br><br>&#x201c;Your eyes are open.&#x201d; Blade broke out a grin that destroyed any chance of staying pissed off at him.<br><br>Labeling Blade a &#x201c;close friend&#x201d; stretched the definition only because a true friend gave unconditional trust. Jeremy had learned at birth that anyone, even family, would eventually turn their back on you.<br><br>However, when it came to extending trust to someone other than Jeremy&#x2019;s teammates in BAD, Blade was that rare exception.<br><br>&#x201c;Now that we&#x2019;ve determined your state of mind,&#x201d; Blade continued with his line of trash talk. &#x201c;Glad I spotted you. I got a sizzlin&#x2019;-hot babe you don&#x2019;t wanna miss, right over there.&#x201d;<br><br>Jeremy looked in the direction Blade hooked his thumb over his shoulder. Two voluptuous smiling beauties dressed in costume were walking toward them through the middle of the park.<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;re they?&#x201d; Jeremy hoped his unchecked irritation hadn&#x2019;t come through, but introducing him to any woman right now was really bad timing. The last thing he needed was for CeCe to come out of her trance and see him flirting with another female.<br><br>But Blade noticed the smallest things sometimes and Jeremy wasn&#x2019;t ready to let him know about his infatuation with CeCe.<br><br>&#x201c;That black diamond in the Cleopatra outfit is Cleo. She&#x2019;s <i>mine</i>.&#x201d; Blade waggled his eyebrows. &#x201c;That redheaded seductress is Shelilah.&#x201d; He drew out the name <i>Shuh-liii-luh</i> in adoration.<br><br>&#x201c;Shelilah? Is that even a real name? Did they have Shelilahs in Roman time?&#x201d; Weren&#x2019;t all these statues of emperors from Rome?<br><br>&#x201c;Details, details. Her name&#x2019;s probably Sheila.&#x201d; Blade beamed one of his on-the-move smiles at the women and lifted a finger for them to wait a minute then turned to Jeremy. &#x201c;Come on, man. You&#x2019;re my lucky charm. These two are perfect. Right up your alley&#x2014;hot women looking for some quick action then leaving tomorrow for Florida. All they want are a couple man toys for a night.&#x201d;<br><br>A disposable date.<br><br>Jeremy had been disposable from the first hours of his life when his mother tossed him into the closest Dumpster. He hadn&#x2019;t fared much better in all the foster homes after that. The only place that ever wanted to keep him had been juvie. He&#x2019;d learned skills in there that put him on a path to fast money and hard time.<br><br>But all that stopped with BAD, or at least changed, since he now committed crimes only when ordered to for a mission.<br><br>Jeremy shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pass, but thanks anyhow.&#x201d; He had only forty-eight hours left and intended to spend as much time as he could with CeCe <i>if</i> she gave him the green light.<br><br>This was his only chance. He could be gone for a week or a month.<br><br>By then, CeCe could be in someone else&#x2019;s arms.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you crazy? What&#x2019;s wrong with you?&#x201d; Blade growled and hooked his thumbs in the corners of his jean pockets. &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t seen you with a skirt in two weeks. Thought you were healed.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Three weeks, actually, to be exact</i>. <i>But who&#x2019;s counting?</i><br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m healed.&#x201d; The wound in his thigh was sore but he could function. &#x201c;Like you said, none that you&#x2019;ve <i>seen</i> me with.&#x201d; Jeremy glanced over at the CeCe statue, no idea what possessed him to want a woman who said she&#x2019;d just moved away from home for the first time. She had a quick wit and wasn&#x2019;t the least bit meek. Too sweet to be worldly or a quick fling...<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, J. Get out of that damn funk you&#x2019;ve been in. You don&#x2019;t come charm these women I&#x2019;m gonna revoke your badass license.&#x201d; Blade grinned, which meant his devious mind was up to no good. &#x201c;In fact, I&#x2019;ll tell everyone in the hood you done turned pansy-assed on us and can&#x2019;t get it up around a knockout woman no more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You bite, you know that? Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d; Jeremy resigned himself to making small talk until he could find a way to get out of Blade&#x2019;s deal without insulting Shelilah and before CeCe left the festival, or saw him first.<br><br>Then what? Stroll back over to the statues when she came out of her trance and pretend he <i>happened</i> to be at the festival and, oh, what a surprise to run into each other?<br><br>Pansy ass.<br><br>SAM THE MAN clawed his way over a chain-link fence, dropped, and hit the ground running. Georgia humidity soaked his black open-collar shirt, his new one, damn it. He gasped for air, dodging between older clapboard houses just off the square in Marietta.<br><br>Quick glance back. They weren&#x2019;t close. Keep moving.<br><br>The neighborhood canine chorus grew with every yard he disturbed. Sam toed a foothold on a rear gate of one yard and plunged into an unfenced one, finally.<br><br>A rottweiler lunged, teeth bared, but the six feet of sturdy chain attached to one honkin&#x2019;-big doghouse held while Sam sprinted past.<br><br>He burst from the narrow alley between well-tended aging homes and slowed to a quick walk. Cars were tucked bumper to bumper along both sides of the quiet side street. Shouts and barking from behind meant his tail was gaining on him. Time to make some serious mileage. He broke from the manicured yards thick with landscape and raced down the sidewalk. Clutching the photo card he had to deliver, he cursed the friend he&#x2019;d trusted.<br><br>The friend who&#x2019;d set him up.<br><br>But since no one could be completely trusted, Sam had taken the precaution of a backup plan. Never knew when a deal would suck toilet water.<br><br>Starface&#x2019;s two armed thugs hard on his ass pretty much flushed his day down the sewer.<br><br>Trusting the feds to come through in time had been a gamble to begin with, but maybe he should have set up the meet spot in advance. Now he was looking at bad odds, because the feds probably couldn&#x2019;t get to him in time. He&#x2019;d sent a text message on the run for them to meet him in Marietta Square. The crowds milling around some damn festival there today would cover him long enough for the feds to snatch him out of sight.<br><br>But when Sam reached the square in sixty seconds he doubted even Superman could make it here in time.<br><br>He sliced across Church Street to where the crazy-looking event was winding down, the crowd thinning. He slowed to a fast walk as he entered the historic square, searching for a spot to hide his prize. All the tents would be picked up tonight.<br><br>Damn, no help there.<br><br>The smell of fresh popcorn fattened the air. He had to be careful not to draw the attention of off-duty cops working the event. They&#x2019;d get him killed and probably a few of them, too. Sam zigzagged against a sea of teens bundled in groups and couples strolling, oblivious of any danger. Some of the patrons wore shorts but others were in togas. Huh?<br><br>A dumpy Caesar wannabe glared when Sam bumped the short bastard&#x2019;s bone-thin Cleopatra.<br><br>Sam clutched the tiny photo card, thinking. The feds would stick out like the Blues Brothers in this crowd <i>if</i> they were here, which they weren&#x2019;t. He needed a plan C at this point and slowed, searching for a safe spot to hide the memory card that was no bigger than a quarter. He passed an eight-foot-tall train engine replica packed with kids using it like a jun...</p><h2>Radio-Control Car Manual: The complete guide to buying, building and maintaining</h2><p>The book describes the types of radio-control cars from choosing between pre-built and kits, on-road and off-road, cars and trucks, gas(nitro) and electric power.

Thus author Rawia Bishara explains her approach in this book.</b><br>She believes one of the greatest assets of Middle Eastern cuisine is its inherent fluidity, its remarkable capacity to adapt and transform over time. In <i>Levant</i>, she offers more than 100 recipes that represent a new modern style. These are the very best of the dishes she has developed over the last twenty years in her New York City restaurant for the contemporary palate. Relying on a traditional pantry (including olive oil, tahini, za'atar, sumac), she updates classic flavour profiles to dazzling effect.<br>The Mediterranean diet has always been a healthy one, with so many of what we now call `superfoods' at its base. But here Rawia takes it a step further by focusing on dishes that are naturally vegetarian or vegan and gluten-free, as well as meat dishes where vegetables take the leading role. These recipes represent the way more and more people eat and cook today. Among them are Cauliflower `Steak' with Pomegranate Molasses, Roasted Beetroot Hummus, Jerusalem Artichoke and Beef Stew, Peppers with Walnut Stuffing and Freekeh and Butternut Squash Salad.<br><i>Levant </i>explores the sensational cross-cultural possibilities of culinary exchange; it sets the path for the future of Middle Eastern cooking.</p><p>Rawia Bishara opened the restaurant Tanoreen in 1998 as a way to share with the world the rich culinary heritage of her native Nazareth. Located in Brooklyn, Tanoreen has received praise from publications including <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Travel &amp; Leisure</i> and the <i>Michelin Guide</i>. In 2017, Rawia was nominated for the James Beard Foundation award for Best Chef, New York City."Levant perfectly captures the joyful spirit of Rawia's renowned restaurant.

He also reports for National Public Radio from New York City.In what he describes as "a quirky piece of personal and agricultural storytelling," Browning (A Queer Geography) contemplates aspects of the "forbidden fruit," from its probable origins in the mountains of Kazakhstan to its modern transformation into a high-tech product of commercial orchards. In his quest for knowledge about the apple, he talks to collectors of old varieties, commercial monoculturists, genetic engineers and master cider-makers. He travels to Kazakhstan to meet a scientist who devotes his life to the preservation of the world's original apple forests; to Geneva, N.Y., to visit Cornell University's apple-breeding program; and to France, England and the western hills of Virginia to taste traditional ciders. Although he is unenthusiastic about the perfectly shaped but bland Golden Delicious, Jonathans, Red Delicious, Granny Smiths and Fujis found in supermarkets today, he realizes that the tastier heirloom varieties such as Westfield Seek-No-Further, Newton Pippin, Winter Pearmain and Roxbury Russet are not commercially viable. Accepting the apple as a "full partner in the age of science and modernism," he's optimistic that breeders, perhaps by crossing apples from the primeval forests of Kazakhstan with other varieties, will create new apples that are flavorful as well as long-keeping, hardy and disease-resistant. A chapter on the apple in mythology and religion is a bit superficial, but for the most part, Browning, who owns an apple orchard in Kentucky, is informative and entertaining, though his story lacks the overarching historical context or the narrative drive of a book like Mark Kurlansky's Cod. Appendices include descriptions of 20 "prize" apples, new and old; a brief discussion of rootstocks and tree sizes, for backyard orchardists; and a sampling of apple and cider recipes from around the world.

Some of the images were addressed directly to women through advertisements, as illustrations accompanying articles in women&#x2019;s magazines, and on the &#x201c;women&#x2019;s pages&#x201d; in daily newspapers. Others illustrated domestic and international news stories, promoted tourism, or publicized the latest Mexican and Hollywood films. In <i>Imagining la Chica Moderna</i>, Joanne Hershfield examines these images, exploring how the modern woman was envisioned in Mexican popular culture and how she figured into postrevolutionary contestations over Mexican national identity.<p></p><p>Through her detailed interpretations of visual representations of la chica moderna, Hershfield demonstrates how the images embodied popular ideas and anxieties about sexuality, work, motherhood, and feminine beauty, as well as class and ethnicity. Her analysis takes into account the influence of <i>mexicanidad</i>, the vision of Mexican national identity promoted by successive postrevolutionary administrations, and the fashions that arrived in Mexico from abroad, particularly from Paris, New York, and Hollywood. She considers how ideals of the modern housewife were promoted to Mexican women through visual culture; how working women were represented in illustrated periodicals and in the Mexican cinema; and how images of traditional &#x201c;types&#x201d; of Mexican women, such as <i>la china poblana</i> (the rural woman), came to define a &#x201c;domestic exotic&#x201d; form of modern femininity. Scrutinizing photographs of Mexican women that accompanied articles in the Mexican press during the 1920s and 1930s, Hershfield reflects on the ways that the real and the imagined came together in the production of la chica moderna.</p></p><p>"Joanne Hershfield's book will become an essential reference guide for unpacking la chica moderna as a central trope of postrevolutionary Mexican society. By demonstrating the ways that `the modern girl' was simultaneously cosmopolitan and native, Hershfield makes sense of the seemingly out-of-place phenomenon of the `Mexican flapper' and her multiple meanings within the project of Mexican nationhood."--Eric Zolov, author of Refried Elvis: The Rise of the Mexican Counterculture<p>"Imagining la Chica Moderna is an engaging book that both demonstrates the role of gender in fashioning the Mexican nation and underscores the primacy of popular culture in that enterprise."-- Ann Marie Stock, editor of Framing Latin American Cinema: Contemporary Critical Perspectives</p>&#34;&#34;Imagining la Chica Moderna&#34; is an engaging book that both demonstrates the role of gender in fashioning the Mexican nation and underscores the primacy of popular culture in that enterprise.&#34;--Ann Marie Stock, editor of &#34;Framing Latin American Cinema: Contemporary Critical Perspectives&#34;</p><h2>Marching to Zion: A History of the Apostolic Christian Church of America, 1847-1982</h2><p>History of the Apostolic Christian Church of America 1847 - 1982.

Like the May of Teck Club itself - &#34;three times window-shattered since 1940 but never directly hit&#34; - its lady inhabitants do their best to act as if the world were back to normal: practicing elocution, and jostling over suitors and a single Schiaparelli gown. The novel&#39;s ending reveals that the girls&#39; giddy literary and amorous peregrinations are hiding some tragically painful war wounds.<p><strong>Muriel Spark</strong> (1918-2006) was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. She was the author of over twenty novels, including <em>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</em>, as well as critical biographies, radio plays, children's books, poetry, and short-story collections.

And she loves blowing bubbles even more. One day, while out with her <i>abuelita, </i>she finds a mysterious kind of gum she&#x2019;s never seen before. She pops it in her mouth and blows a giant bubble that lifts her up into the air and carries her on a magical journey.</p><p>Luscious, candy-colored paintings illustrate this fantastical story with an ecological twist.

She lives in Flagstaff, Arizona, and is an Assoc. Professor of English at NAU, specializing in U.S. Latino and Multicultural Literature. You can learn more about her at www.monicabrown.net.Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2014;When bubble-gum-loving Chavela finds a package of Magic Chicle at her corner store, she can't wait to chomp it. The little girl is delightfully surprised when it makes a giant bubble that carries her across California, Arizona, and Texas to the Yucat�n, where she learns how the sap, or chicle, from sapodilla trees becomes her beloved bubble gum. An author's note describes how chicle harvesting has declined since gum manufacturers started using synthetic ingredients. It also explains how sapodilla trees grow in disappearing rain forests and provides Web sites where children can learn more about rain forest preservation and sustainable farming. By confining these environmental messages to her note, Brown creates a charming story that celebrates the joys of gum chewing, and of natural beauty, without becoming didactic. The text is full of strong verbs, such as "swooped," "popped," and "chomped," which underscore the energetic glee of childhood. Clever fonts also enhance the text. Spanish words appear in different typefaces and colors. Meanwhile, Morales's bright candy colors perfectly evoke chewing gum's various and vivid hues. Luminescent pinks and oranges are the dominant colors, further enhancing the story's joyful tone. The illustrative details also underscore the child's Mexican-American heritage. For example, there is corn drying in the kitchen, and traditional embroidery on Abuelita's dress. Children of all backgrounds will enjoy her adventures.&#x2014;<i>Mary Landrum, Lexington Public Library, KY</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2010.

It came as a surprise when his family was transported to the Terez�n concentration camp and an even greater surprise when most of them survived. They returned home to a city in economic turmoil and falling into the grip of Communism. Against this tumultuous backdrop, Kl�ma discovered his love of literature and matured as a writer. But as the regime further encroached on daily life, arresting his father and censoring his work, Kl�ma recognized the party for what it was: a deplorable, colossal lie. The true nature of oppression became clear to him and many of his peers, among them Josef &#x160;kvoreck�, Milan Kundera, and V�clav Havel. From the brief hope of freedom during the Prague Spring of 1968 to Charter 77 and the eventual collapse of the regime in 1989&#x2019;s Velvet Revolution, Kl�ma&#x2019;s revelatory account provides a profoundly rich personal and national history.</p><p>Ivan Klima was born in Prague in 1931. He is the award-winning author of over 20 novels, including "Waiting for the Dark, Waiting for the Light," "No Saints or Angels," "The Ultimate Intimacy," and "Lovers for a Day"--all "New York Times" Notable Books of the Year. <br>Craig Cravens (translator) has taught Czech language and culture for over 10 years; he is currently a senior lecturer at Indiana State University. He has a PhD in Slavic languages and literature from Princeton University and a BA from Amherst College in Russian Literature."In <i>My Crazy Century</i>, the renowned Czech writer Ivan Kl�ma masterfully recounts, first, what it was like for him as a Jewish child confronting with his family the inhumanities of the Theresienstadt concentration camp situated at the edge of their hometown, Prague. Then, more fully, he painstakingly recalls what it was like for him and his countrymen after the Nazi thugs were driven out by the Soviet Army and replaced for four decades by the Communist thugs. How Kl�ma and his Czechoslovakian colleagues among them some of the best writers in postwar Europe endured the relentless infraction of their fundamental rights is chronicled here through the private history of one who steadily stood up to his oppressors and who has thought deeply about the degradation and deformation conferred on a decent society by the lawless thuggery of Europe&#x2019;s twentieth-century ideological monsters, one who preached racial purity and the annihilation of the Jews, the other working-class purity and the annihilation of the wealthy, the bourgeoisie, and anyone capable of independent thought. In its telling, forthright intimacy Kl�ma&#x2019;s book merits a place alongside such eyewitness accounts of the evils of totalitarianism as Eugenia Ginzburg&#x2019;s <i>Within the Whirlwind</i> and Solzhenitsyn&#x2019;s <i>Cancer Ward</i> and <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i>." Philip Roth<br><br>"<i>My Crazy Century</i> is the prizewinning memoir of a writer who, deprived of freedom for much of this life, never ceased to be free in his imagination, creativity, and art. Neither Nazi nor Communist rulers could rob Ivan Kl�ma of his amazing ability and fierce determination to distill drops of truth from the sea of experience. Kl�ma was a witness, and participant, in the most dramatic events in twentieth century Europe. This is his story, brilliantly, wittily and poignantly told." Madeleine Albright<br><br>"<i>My Crazy Century</i> describes how a man lived without freedom and fought for it. . . .

More than a memoir, the book is the intellectual history of a city and a memorial to its inhabitants, who, laboring underground, kept the idea of democracy alive after the Prague Spring. A fitting capstone to a distinguished literary life." <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>"Impassioned . . .

He tells the stories of French artisans and chefs who continue to work at the highest level. Many people in and out of France have noted for a long time the slow retreat of French cuisine, concerned that it is losing its important place in the country's culture and in the world culture of food. And yet, as Behr writes, good French food remains very, very delicious. No cuisine is better. The sensuousness is overt. French cooking is generous, both obvious and subtle, simple and complex, rustic and utterly refined. A lot of recent inventive food by comparison is wildly abstract and austere. In the tradition of great food writers, Edward Behr seeks out the best of French food and wine. He shows not only that it is as relevant as ever, but he also challenges us to see that it might become the world's next cutting edge cuisine.<br><br>France remains the greatest country for bread, cheese, and wine, and its culinary techniques are the foundation of the training of nearly every serious Western cook and some beyond. Behr talks with chefs and goes to see top artisanal producers in order to understand what "the best" means for them, the nature of traditional methods, how to enjoy the foods, and what the optimal pairings are. As he searches for the very best in French food and wine, he introduces a host of important, memorable people.&nbsp;<br><br>THE FOOD AND WINE OF FRANCE is a remarkable journey of discovery.

Nine Buddhist temple members&#x2014;six of them monks committed to lives of non-violence&#x2014;lay dead in a pool of blood, shot execution style. The massive manhunt that followed turned up no leads until a tip from a psychiatric patient led to the arrest of five suspects. Each initially denied their involvement in the crime, yet one by one, under intense interrogation, they confessed.<br><br>Soon after, all five men recanted, saying their confessions had been coerced. One was freed after providing an alibi, but the remaining suspects&#x2014;dubbed &#x201c;The Tucson Four&#x201d; by the media&#x2014;remained in custody even though no physical evidence linked them to the crime.<br><br>Seven weeks later, investigators discovered&#x2014;almost by chance&#x2014;physical evidence that implicated two entirely new suspects. The Tucson Four were finally freed on November 22 after two teenage boys confessed to the crime, yet troubling questions remained. Why were confessions forced out of innocent suspects? Why and how did legal authorities build a case without evidence? And, ultimately, how did so much go so wrong?<br><br>In this first book-length treatment of the Buddhist Temple Massacre, Gary L. Stuart explores the unspeakable crime, the inexplicable confessions, and the troubling behavior of police officials. Stuart&#x2019;s impeccable research for the book included a review of the complete legal records of the case, an examination of all the physical evidence, a survey of three years of print and broadcast news, and more than fifty personal interviews related to the case. Like <i>In Cold Blood</i>, and <i>The Executioner&#x2019;s Song, Innocent Until Interrogated</i> is a riveting read that provides not only a striking account of the crime and the investigation but also a disturbing look at the American justice system at its very worst.</p><p>This riveting book revisits one of the most horrific crimes in Arizona&#39;s history: the mass murder of nine residents of a Buddhist temple near Phoenix in 1991. Like &#34;In Cold Blood&#34; and other true-life crime books, it is a page-turner. But it also raises troubling questions about modern police procedures.Gary L. Stuart is an attorney in Phoenix. He is the author of six books, including <i>The Gallup 14</i>, a novel based on the notorious court case of 1930s New Mexico, and <i>Miranda: The Story of America&#x2019;s Right to Remain Silent</i></p><h2>Women in Ancient Egypt /anglais</h2><p><p>An idealised version of women appears everywhere in the art of ancient Egypt, but the true nature of these women's lives has long remained hidden. Robins' book, gracefully written and copiously illustrated, cuts through the obscurity of the ages to show us what the archaeological riches of Egypt really say about how these women lived, both in the public eye and within the family.</p><p>The art and written records of the time present a fascinating puzzle. But how often has the evidence been interpreted, consciously or otherwise, from a male viewpoint? Robins conducts us through these sources with an archaeologist's relish, stripping away layer after interpretive layer to expose the reality beneath. Here we see the everyday lives of women in the economic, legal, or domestic sphere, from the Early Dynastic Period almost 5,000 years ago to the conquest of Alexander in 332 B.C. Within this kingdom ruled and run by men, women could still wield influence indirectly&#x2015;and in some cases directly, when a woman took the position of king. The exceptional few who assumed real power appear here in colorful detail, alongside their more traditional counterparts. Robins examines the queens' reputed divinity and takes a frank look at the practice of incest within Egypt's dynasties. She shows us the special role of women in religious rites and offices, and assesses their depiction in Egyptian art as it portrays their position in society.</p><p>By drawing women back into the picture we have of ancient Egypt, this book opens a whole new perspective on one of world history's most exotic and familiar cultures.</p></p><p>Gay Robins is Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Art History at Emory University.Beautiful as they are, Egypt's ladies barely make it into the historical record. We have no firsthand accounts, and their thoughts will eternally remain a mystery...This makes Gay Robins' authoritative <i>Women in Ancient Egypt</i> doubly welcome. Ms. Robins, who teaches Egyptology at Emory University in Atlanta, knows her stuff. In astonishingly few pages, she covers 3,000 years of politics, economics, family, society, religion and art. She backs every statement with the hard evidence of artifacts and texts, and if she offers a theory she marks it as such. Her book stands head and shoulders above sensationalist popularizations...[It] is a book you can trust...Ms. Robins writes clearly and well...[and] provides rewarding fare. Her discussion of marriage...is lively with examples and rich in detail. (Elizabeth J. Sherman <i>Washington Times</i>)<br><br>This book relies on artistic, archaeological, and written evidence to reconstruct the private and public lives of women in Egypt from approximately 3000 to 300 BCE...Robins analyzes particularly skillfully the challenges and problems inherent in her study, including the familiar problem of trying to reconstruct women's lives when scholars have maintained a persistent silence about them; evidence that may be fragmentary or derived from biased sources; evidence that often excludes entire classes of women; and modern prejudices that encourages errors in interpreting the evidence.

That&#x2019;s how it feels, like it&#x2019;ll burn through the fabric and drop off into the dirty snow of the sidewalk, maybe roll into the sewer grate and disappear into the slurry below. And if that were to happen, how would he feel? He&#x2019;d feel horrible. He loves Sarah. He wants to marry Sarah. But he can&#x2019;t marry her with this ring. A ring too big for her perfect porcelain fingers. A big ring with a diamond too small. A ring he inherited from his mother.<br> <br>Still. The ring&#x2019;s like a loaded gun. He&#x2019;s almost proposed five times in the last couple weeks. Part of him thinks, Just propose, you can get the ring resized, get a new diamond later. Before the wedding. Which won&#x2019;t be for a year anyway. Oh, God, unless she wants to get married soon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>But no. He has to do this right. Her father thinks Andrew does everything half-ass. And her father means the world to her. Andrew has to make this a good show. The ring has to impress her, but more important, it has to impress her father. The problem: Even Sarah doesn&#x2019;t know how bad Andrew&#x2019;s got it right now. He&#x2019;s got a good job at a brokerage here in Philly, but he&#x2019;s thirty thousand in credit card debt. Not to mention the car loan. And the student loans from b-school and from grad school. And the rent. The gas bill. The trash bill. The this bill. The that bill.<br> <br>He&#x2019;s got a little money in his pocket but, really, he&#x2019;s broke.<br> <br>Which is why he&#x2019;s out here now. In Kensington at quarter till eleven on a Wednesday night. Walking through a pissy wet snowfall&#x2014;fat, clumpy flakes not drifting so much as plopping to the earth. His nice shoes white from the road salt. His socks wet from the slush.<br> <br>Derek at work said, &#x201c;You want a diamond cheap, I know a place.&#x201d; Derek said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s in Kensington.&#x201d; and Andrew said, &#x201c;Oh, hell no, Kenzo? Really?&#x201d; He said that if he goes down there, he&#x2019;ll get stabbed. Or strangled. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t the Kensington Strangler still around down there?&#x201d; Derek just laughed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s old news. Crime&#x2019;s down. It&#x2019;s fine. You want the diamond cheap, or you want to pay jewelry store prices?&#x201d;<br> <br>Andrew thought but did not say, &#x201c;I want to pay jewelry store prices.&#x201d;<br> <br>He just can&#x2019;t afford to.<br> <br>And so, a pawn shop. Derek said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s called K&amp;P Moneyloan Pawn, except they don&#x2019;t speak a lot of English and they misspelled Moneyloan so it says Moneylawn, so at least you&#x2019;ll know you have the right place.&#x201d;<br> <br>Andrew thought he&#x2019;d get there right after work, six, maybe seven o&#x2019;clock. But suddenly the team of in-house lawyers demanded a new meeting at work, and meetings are like black holes: They eat up the hours, they suck in the light, they gorge on his produc�tivity. Next thing he knew, it was past ten o&#x2019;clock and he still had to get to Kensington.<br> <br>The pawn shop was still open. Thank God.<br> <br>The guy behind the counter&#x2014; a guy Derek said was Indian (&#x201c;Curry Indian, not Wounded Knee Indian&#x201d;) but that Andrew thinks is Sri Lankan&#x2014; showed him the diamonds and everything looked good; the prices were low enough he almost wondered if they were real, and there he had a small panic attack because wasn&#x2019;t he supposed to remember something about the three Cs? Color, clarity, cut and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was there a fourth C?<br> <br>Crap! Whatever. He&#x2019;s no expert. Neither is Sarah. He picked a princess-cut diamond that looked&#x2014;well, it looked pretty. It caught the light. It felt heavy. Sharp, too, like it could cut a hole in the storefront window.<br> <br>So there he stood in a dingy, cracked-floor pawn shop, the too-bright fluorescents above humming and clicking, neon lights trapped between the pawn shop window and the big metal grate just inside the windows, and finally he managed to argue the little Sri Lankan man down to a price he could afford (a price less than half of what he&#x2019;d pay anywhere else), and then he whipped out his Visa and&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;No credit card,&#x201d; the little man said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have a debit card&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No take, no take.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s what I have.&#x201d;<br> <br>The little man pulled back the small cloth with the diamond on it. &#x201c;Cash only. No diamond. Only cash. No diamond.&#x201d;<br> <br>So he asked, &#x201c;Is there an ATM machine around?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is just ATM,&#x201d; the little man said. &#x201c;No ATM machine. ATM mean Automated Teller Machine. You no need to say extra machine.&#x201d;<br> <br>This from a man whose store is named Moneylawn.<br> <br>Andrew said fine, fine, just tell me where, and he thought&#x2014;hoped&#x2014;that the ATM was right across the street, but no, of course it wasn&#x2019;t, it was three blocks up and four blocks over and now the sky is really flinging the glops of wet snow down on his head as if to punish him for his bad money management&#x2014;<br> <br>So now here he is. Hurrying along. To an ATM in the middle of Kensington. A neighborhood no longer in decline because it can&#x2019;t decline any further&#x2014;the car has already crashed, the wreck has already burned out.<br> <br>Derelict storefronts. A lone pizza joint at the corner, still open. Eyes watching him from under a ratty overhang. Past an alley where a homeless guy in an overcoat sleeps in the shade of a dented Dumpster, using a blue tarp as a blanket. Someone yelling a block over&#x2014; a Hispanic girl in a half-shirt and jeans, no jacket, no hat, bronze hair peppered with white flakes, and she&#x2019;s screaming at some little thug in a leather jacket, saying something about sucking his dick, something about someone named Rosalita. The thug&#x2019;s just laughing. Braying, even. Waving her off.<br> <br>Andrew keeps his head down.<br> <br>Turn around. Go home. The diamond will be there tomorrow.<br> <br>No. Tomorrow is Saturday. He and Sarah are going to Wild�wood Gardens. She loves that place. The orchid house. The Christmas lights. He&#x2019;s going to ask her there. Do the whole thing: down on one knee, ring up, maybe in front of a crowd so they have that story to tell.<br> <br>Just walk. Hurry up. You need to do this. Man up, Andrew. What would her father say?<br> <br>Her father would say nothing. He&#x2019;d just stare at Andrew with those dark gray eyes, eyes like bits of driveway gravel.<br> <br>Ahead&#x2014; a basketball court. Tall fences. Three courts lined up next to each other. He can shortcut the block, he thinks.<br> <br>But then&#x2014;<br> <br>Footsteps. Behind him. Crossing the street. Splashing in slush.<br> <br>He casts a quick glance over his shoulder.<br> <br>A shadow following. Hands in pockets. Dark camo. Hood up.<br> <br>His heart starts kicking.<br> <br>He hurries forward. Half a short block to the basketball courts. His foot catches on an uneven sidewalk&#x2014;he falls forward, just barely catches himself, but he takes the opportunity to shift into a brisk walk, almost a jog.<br> <br>But the person behind him is coming up fast now.<br> <br>Faster than he is. A swift step.<br> <br>The person raises a gloved hand. Points a finger-gun at him.<br> <br>The thumb-hammer falls.<br> <br>Andrew hurries. Grabs the pole holding up the chain link leading into the basketball courts. He ducks in through the gate&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; calls a voice.<br> <br>A woman&#x2019;s voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Andrew!&#x201d;<br> <br>She knows his name?<br> <br>Thud. Something hits him hard in the back.<br> <br>Snow plops.<br> <br>A snowball. She hit him with a snowball.<br> <br>He wheels. Holds up both hands, palms forward. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know who you are or what you want, but I don&#x2019;t want any trouble&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman hooks her thumbs around the hood, flips it back. It&#x2019;s some white girl. She shakes free a shaggy ink-black pixie cut, the front bangs streaked with red. She stares at him from raccoon-�dark eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;You dumb shit,&#x201d; she says, baring her teeth from behind a fishhook sneer. &#x201c;What are you doing out here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. huh?&#x201d;<br> <br>She sighs as snow falls. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why I&#x2019;m yelling at you. I knew you&#x2019;d be here. Isn&#x2019;t that why I&#x2019;m here?&#x201d; She taps a cigarette out of a rumpled pack of Natural American Spirits. Cigarette between lips. Clink of a lighter. Flame in the winter. Blue smoke.<br> <br>He coughs. Fans the smoke away.<br> <br>&#x201c;I gotta go,&#x201d; he says.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t remember me,&#x201d; she says. A statement, not a question.<br> <br>&#x201c;What? No I&#x2014;&#x201d; Wait. The way one she stares from under an arched and dubious brow. He knows that look. A look of unmitigated incredulity. A mean-girl look like she&#x2019;s saying, You&#x2019;d really wear those pants with that shirt? Sarah gives him that look sometimes. Her judgey face. &#x201c;Yeah. Hold up. I remember you. From the bus.&#x201d;<br> <br>She gestures at him with the cigarette. &#x201c;Got it in one.&#x201d;<br> <br>A year ago. On the SEPTA NiteOwl route home to University City.<br> <br>His stomach suddenly drops out from under him.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. told me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He tries to remember. He was tired that night. No. Drunk. He was drunk that night. Not black-out-and-wake-up-in-Jersey drunk, but drinks with Derek and the other brokers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Did Sarah yell at him that night? No. They were only just together then. Not even living with each other. They&#x2019;d just met.<br> <br>The woman vents smoke through her teeth. &#x201c;You have a ring in your pocket. Left pocket, I think.&#x201d;<br> <br>His gaze darts down. His hand reflexively touches the pocket. There the ring is heavy. The One Ring, he thinks. On the way to Mordor. Absurd that he&#x2019;s thinking about that. He doesn&#x2019;t even like those books.<br> <br>&#x201c;How do you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; But then it all hits him. Ice breaking. Water rushing. The memory cold as the slap of the winter air.<br> <br>On the bus. He&#x2019;d seen her there before. Sitting in the back. Earbuds in. Then one day she came up to him. Sat behind him. Started talking. He&#x2019;d had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what were they? A bunch of Long Island Iced Teas. How do they get them to taste so much like iced tea? They turned her into a smudgy blur, a Vaseline thumbprint on the lens of his life.<br> <br>She just started talking. Like she couldn&#x2019;t stop, like someone karate-kicked the spigot right off the sink&#x2014;words spraying everywhere. She was amped, jacked up in the same way he was slowed down, and she told him&#x2014;<br> <br>You&#x2019;re gonna die.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s what she said.<br> <br>She knows about the ring now because she knew about it then. Didn&#x2019;t she? She told him he&#x2019;d have a ring in his pocket, and he said that was absurd. At the time he hadn&#x2019;t even thought of marrying Sarah, but here he was, with a ring&#x2014;his dead mother&#x2019;s own engagement ring&#x2014;there in his pocket, a modest little circle of white gold, too modest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>The girl gave him a date. Told him to &#x201c;mark his calendar.&#x201d;<br> <br>Was tonight that date?<br> <br>He doesn&#x2019;t even realize he asked the question out loud.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. It&#x2019;s tonight, genius.&#x201d; You really should&#x2019;ve written it down. I told you to write it down. I said, &#x2018;Whip out your fancy smartphone and write it the fuck down.&#x2019; But did you? Mmm. No. You just puked on your shoes.&#x201d; She suddenly pauses, as if in rumi�nation. &#x201c;Okay, maybe I should have waited till you weren&#x2019;t drunk to give you the news, though at the time I thought it might soften the blow. I&#x2019;d been watching you for days. I brushed by you on a Monday, didn&#x2019;t tell you until Thursday.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re crazy,&#x201d; he says, backpedaling.<br> <br>&#x201c;Be that as it may, Andrew, that doesn&#x2019;t change what&#x2019;s coming.&#x201d;<br> <br>He says it again&#x2014;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re crazy&#x201d;&#x2014;because he can&#x2019;t find any other words, because his brain is suddenly a snarl of sparking, rat-chewed wires, and he knows he&#x2019;s being played. Conned, somehow. He takes a step back, turns&#x2014; starts hurrying across the basketball court.<br> <br>She&#x2019;s after him. Like stink on a skunk.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re processing this poorly,&#x201d; she yells. &#x201c;Totally normal, by the way. This was all kind of an experiment for me. I&#x2019;ve run it again and again, and it always runs smack into the same dead end every time.&#x201d; She clears her throat. &#x201c;No pun intended until now. Hey. Slow down. Wait up.&#x201d;<br> <br>But he keeps hurrying.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get away,&#x201d; he says.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got an appointment to keep, huh? Running right toward the reaper&#x2019;s bony hug. Fate, man. Fucking fate! See? I told you how it was going to shake out. I gave you all the details&#x2014;the date, the ring, the ATM machine&#x201d;&#x2014;You no need to say extra machine&#x2014;&#x201c;and yet here you are, not walking but sprinting toward the cliff &#x2019;s edge. It&#x2019;s like people want to die.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call the police.&#x201d; He fumbles for his phone. He palms it, turns around while still walking backward and waves the phone at her like it&#x2019;s a weapon. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it. I&#x2019;ll call 911!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Go ahead,&#x201d; she says, stopping. She sucks on the cigarette. &#x201c;Call them. I&#x2019;ll wait. You call them, you might just save your own life, Andy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Andrew. It&#x2019;s Andrew.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever. Ringy-ringy. 911.&#x201d;<br> <br>He holds the phone. Hand trembling.<br> <br>He doesn&#x2019;t call.<br> <br>He doesn&#x2019;t call because he doesn&#x2019;t have the time. If he calls the police, they might actually show up. Then they&#x2019;ll want to talk to him. Take a statement. But the pawn shop closes at midnight.<br> <br>And midnight is fast approaching.<br> <br>Instead, he takes out his house keys. He shoves keys through his fingers and forms a soft, clumsy fist.<br> <br>He shakes the fist at her.<br> <br>She laugh-snorts. &#x201c;What is that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll hit you. It&#x2019;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the keys, the keys&#x2019;ll cut you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you learn that in a movie?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In a defense class.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In a defense class for who? I didn&#x2019;t know you were a middle-�aged housewife, Andy. You cover it up well.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fuck you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There it is. The anger. The resentment. Nobody likes being told they&#x2019;re going to die. They struggle like a sparrow caught in a man&#x2019;s hand. Flapping and scratching and pecking. You can fix this, Andy. Turn around. Go home. Whatever you&#x2019;re doing out here in pissing distance of midnight, do it some other time.&#x201d;<br> <br>He kicks stones and slush at her. Like a child. He feels stupid for doing it but there it is; it&#x2019;s already done.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a fucking lunatic!&#x201d; he shouts at her.<br> <br>The woman just shakes her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the experiment, then. I&#x2019;m calling it. Time of death: fifteen minutes. Go forth, spunky housewife, and meet your maker.&#x201d;<br> <br>She turns then. Pulls her hoodie back over her head. Flicks her cigarette off into the snow.<br> <br>The woman recedes. A slow walk away.<br> <br>She doesn&#x2019;t look back. She&#x2019;s done with him.

Dr. Whitton and Joe Fisher explore the often elusive periods between incarnations, basing their work upon 13 years of research and more than 30 medical case histories and drawing upon the revolutionary technique of hypnotic regression.</p><p>Although evidence for reincarnation is largely circumstantial, the authors defend that theory with the results of 13 years of Whitton's research involving 30 subjects interviewed under hypnosis. Whitton, a psychotherapist and clinical hypnotist, and reporter Fisher ( The Case for Reincarnation conclude from reports of subjects emerging from deep trancessix of whose dramatic cases are cited herethat after death the soul returns to the same timeless, spaceless condition that it left to be born, a state in which it remains until called upon to fulfill its spiritual evolution, or karma, by returning to earth. Reliving former, often traumatic lives, the authors claim, provides subjects with beneficial insights into present problems. For those who wish to attempt self-exploration of the past, visualization techniques, intended to evoke memories of earlier lives, are provided. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Here described is Toronto psychiatrist Whitton's research regarding the Bardo, the state between incarnations. Whitton found that if he used hypnosis to regress patients to past lives and especially to the Bardo, in which the soul is said to choose the circumstances of its next life to work out certain personal problems, outstanding results occurred. When patients realize that they have chosen their present circumstances, their symptoms abate or disappear, replaced by a healthier attitude. This may be a new game people are playing, but as a therapeutic technique, it works for Whitton. Apparently no one else has yet tried to repeat his results. An absorbing account of one man's dedicated search that makes one wonder. Rhea A.

Benjamin and his friend Elephant descend upon the kitchen just before 4:00 .. to prepare a surprise birthday breakfast for Benjamin's mother. The two arrange cereal dotted with ketchup and red jelly, squeeze fresh orange juice by playing baseball, and clean up their mess before taking Mother a breakfast tray. The frenetic watercolors feature a huge, lovable elephant with a floppy yellow hat and an endearing boy in too-small red pajamas who calls to mind Gerstein's young hero in Arnold of the Ducks (Harper, 1985). Readers will sense the sticky, soggy orange juice mess on the floor, and easily identify the cheese and pickle juice that create a macaroni-based cereal. The text is a hodgepodge of choppy rhyme and straight prose. The march of time is sometimes noted in numbers, and sometimes alphabetically, adding to the overall confusion of the experience. A nighttime foray into the kitchen is handled much more masterfully in Sendak's In the Night Kitchen (Harper, 1970) and Hest's The Midnight Eaters (Macmillan, 1989). --Reva Pitch Margolis, Norwood School, NJ<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.In the wee hours of the morning, Benjamin and Elephant prepare a surprise birthday breakfast for the boy's mother. Elephant makes a special cereal concoction: "Then I plunk a hunk of cheese! Mush the mustard! Pour the peas! Add some rice, and then for spice I think we need some pickle juice . . . " Holding a jar of jelly in his trunk, Elephant next assembles some sandwiches, but in the process knocks over a bag of oranges, which tumble to the floor. Things deteriorate fast when Benjamin and Elephant begin to play catch with the oranges. Soon the kitchen is awash with juice--and Benjamin's mother is awake. But the two manage to get everything cleaned up and breakfast served--despite a great deal of thumpin', bumpin' and rumpus. A capricious rhyme enhances Patz's lively story.

His life had been as dramatic as his death. An Italian Jew from a bourgeois family, "Modi" had a weakness for drink, hashish, and the many women-including the Russian poet Anna Akhmatova-who were drawn to his good looks. His friends included Picasso, Utrillo, Soutine, and other important artists of his day, yet his own work stood apart, generating little interest while he lived. Today's art world, however, acknowledges him as a master whose limited oeuvre-sculptures, portraits, and some of the most appealing nudes in the whole of modern art-cannot satisfy collectors' demand. <br><br>With a lively but judicious hand, biographer Jeffrey Meyers sketches Modigliani and the art he produced, illuminating not only this little-known figure but also the painters, writers, lovers, and others who inhabited early twentieth-century Paris with him. <br></p><p>Jeffrey Meyers is the author of numerous books on literature, film, and art, including biographies of Katherine Mansfield, Joseph Conrad, and Somerset Maugham. He lives in Berkeley, California..<br>Livorno Childhood, <br>1884&#x2013;1899<br>&nbsp;<br>Amedeo Modigliani, full of talent and ambition, arrived in France from his native Italy in his early twenties. Stimulated by the artistic ferment of Paris, he spent the rest of his short life there. But his mind and character were rooted in his Jewish and Italian heritage, and whenever he was at a low point he dreamed of going home. As he lay dying in a charity hospital, his last thoughts were of �Italy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modigliani came from the city of Livorno, the Tuscan port between Genoa and Rome, which had a unique place in the history of Italy. The Duchy of Florence bought the original fortress from Genoa in 1421 after the silting up of the Arno and consequent decay of the port of Pisa, and during the next century Livorno prospered under the rule of the Medicis. In the twenty�-�two�-�year reign of Ferdinando I, who became Duke of Tuscany in 1587, Livorno was rapidly transformed from an insignificant fishing village into a great international port. Ferdinando was the son of Eleanora di Toledo (the subject of a Bronzino portrait). Though he never took holy orders, he became a nominal cardinal at the age of fourteen. A powerful leader, he strengthened the Tuscan navy, defeated the Barbary pirates off the coast of North Africa, crushed the Turks and took lavish spoils. In Livorno, the colossal statue <i>Monumento dei Quattro Mori</i> celebrates Ferdinando&#x2019;s victories over the infidels and portrays him with four huge Moorish slaves supine at his �feet.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ferdinando also built the famous Villa Medici in Rome (later the home of the French Academy and of the Prix de Rome) and bought many priceless paintings and statues. He was a munificent patron of the arts, and created one of the most decorative and artistically vibrant courts in Europe. An English historian praised Ferdinando&#x2019;s achievements and wrote that &#x201c;though extravagant and ostentatious, he immediately displayed a sincere concern for the well�-�being of Florence.&#x201d; His benign, efficient rule reduced corruption, stabilized the economy, encouraged farming, revived trade and strengthened the fleet. He developed Livorno, &#x201c;the masterpiece of the Medicean dynasty,&#x201d; and filled it with new citizens from all over �Europe.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ferdinando was a commercially shrewd as well as an exceptionally enlightened and progressive ruler. By the charter of July 10, 1593, he declared Livorno a free port, exempt from all financial restrictions and beyond the customs frontier of the dukedom. He also created a refuge for all the oppressed people <br>of Europe: Armenians and Orthodox Greeks from Turkey, &#x201c;Catholics from England, Huguenots from France, Mahometan Moors from Christian Spain, Christian Moors from Mahometan Barbary, Corsicans loathing the Genoese yoke, Flemings fleeing before [the Spanish Duke of] Alva, and&#x2014;above all&#x2014;Jews.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only twenty years after Ferdinando&#x2019;s charter, Livorno, with its thriving communities of English and Dutch merchants, had become one of the great centers of Mediterranean trade and, �rivaled only by Amsterdam, of Jewish culture. Cecil Roth, the historian of the Jews, using the English name for Livorno, emphasized its extraordinary freedom and wrote: &#x201c;The only place in Italy where Jewish intellectual life was completely untrammelled was Leghorn. Here, in accordance with the Charter of 1593, there was no interference with Hebrew literature; and in consequence the city became a great center of learning, ultimately outstripping the older seats of culture in the Mediterranean.&#x201d; The great synagogue, begun in 1602 and enlarged in 1789, was one of the major sights of the town, and was often visited by royalty and even by Napoleon himself during his triumphant campaign in northern Italy.1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Livorno attracted distinguished visitors as well as persecuted minorities. The English novelist Tobias Smollett lived a few miles outside Livorno for the last two years of his life, finished <i>Humphrey Clinker</i> there and in 1771, the year of its publication, was buried in the English cemetery. Writing from Monte Nero in May 1770, he told a friend that &#x201c;I am at present rusticated on the slope of a Mountain that overlooks the sea, in the neighbourhood of Leghorne, a most romantic and salutary situation.&#x201d; Percy Shelley, comparing Livorno to the bustling port on the Thames, called it the &#x201c;Wapping of Italy&#x201d; and &#x201c;the most unattractive of cities.&#x201d; His wife, Mary, condemned it as a &#x201c;stupid town.&#x201d; But when they settled next to a farm in August 1819, she softened her judgment and rhapsodized about the pleasures of rural life: &#x201c;We live in a little country house at the end of a green lane surrounded by a <i>podere.</i> . . . It is filled with olive, fig and peachtrees and the hedges are of myrtle. . . . The people are always busy. . . . They sing not very melodiously but very loud&#x2014;Rossini&#x2019;s music.&#x201d;2 Shelley wrote <i>The Cenci</i> and <i>The Mask of Anarchy</i> near Livorno, and in its port took delivery of his schooner, the <i>Ariel,</i> in which he later drowned. Modigliani identified with the flamboyant and rebellious Shelley and agreed with his exalted assertion in <i>A Defence of Poetry</i> that artists and &#x201c;poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the �world.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Livorno&#x2019;s humane tolerance of Jews was strikingly different from the harsh conditions they endured in the rest of Italy. Napoleon&#x2019;s rule and influence were enlightened, but when his armies left the local rulers became unmistakably reactionary. &#x201c;In the States of the Church it was unbending: under the reinstated Pope Pius VII [1800&#x2013;23] the gates of the Roman ghetto were firmly shut upon its Jewish community once more. In Ferrara the ghetto chains were put back.&#x201d; Cecil Roth observed that Livorno &#x201c;was thus, with Pisa, virtually the only place in Italy where the repressive policy of Catholic reaction [against the Jews] made no headway. The Ghetto, with all the degradation which it implied, was never introduced; there was barely any restriction on economic �life.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jewish culture prospered throughout the nineteenth century and the city remained an important center of Hebrew printing. Livorno suffered a decline when it ceased to be a free port in 1868. Though the Jewish population (in a city which then had 100,000 people) decreased in the late nineteenth century from 5,000 to only 1,700, there is still today a higher proportion of Jews in Livorno than in any other Italian city. A cultural historian explained how families like the Modiglianis practiced a less orthodox form of Judaism during Amedeo&#x2019;s lifetime, and how well educated and politically active Jews like his brother Emanuele began to influence society. Until the start of the Great War, Italian Jews usually observed the important ceremonies and holidays, rarely entered mixed marriages and confined their �social life to the family. &#x201c;Italian Jews were brought into society primar�ily through their entry into civil administration and university positions, professional activities that had a political impact.&#x201d; Arnoldo Momigliano, an eminent Italian historian, concluded that Livorno &#x201c;remained the easiest Italian town to live in during at least two centuries and developed that Jewish style of its own which is preserved in the books of [Rabbi Elia] Benamozegh and of which perhaps the paintings of Amedeo Modigliani show traces.&#x201d;3<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modigliani&#x2019;s Livorno was the ugliest place in the most beautiful province of Italy. Karl Baedeker&#x2019;s guidebook reported that it &#x201c;contains little to detain the traveler&#x201d; and the English writer Augustus Hare asserted: &#x201c;There is nothing whatever worth seeing in Leghorn.&#x201d; In <i>Italian Hours,</i> Henry James magisterially declared: &#x201c;It has neither a church worth one&#x2019;s attention, nor a municipal palace, nor a museum, and it may claim the distinction, unique in Italy, of being a city of no pictures.&#x201d; After that harsh judgment, James (like Mary Shelley) relented a little and confessed: &#x201c;[But] as I sat in the garden and, looking up from my book, saw through a gap in the shrubbery the red house�-�tiles against the deep blue sky and the grey underside of the ilex�-�leaves turned up by the Mediterranean breeze, it was all still quite Tuscany, if Tuscany in the minor key.&#x201d; Though Livorno itself was culturally limited, it was close to the Tuscan masterpieces in Florence and Siena. Pisa, only twelve miles up the Arno, had the famous Leaning Tower, a cemetery and a cathedral with mosaics by Cimabue, paintings by Andrea del Sarto and a pulpit carved by Giovanni �Pisano.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Livorno was the birthplace, a generation before Modigliani, of Pietro Mascagni, composer of the popular opera <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i> (1890). His biographer explained that the city was gradually transformed, while Modigliani was still living there, from a thriving port and site of a naval academy to a town of shipbuilding and heavy industry. Livorno became the trading center of the Mediterranean. It imported goods from northern Europe and sold them in Italy and the Levant; imported cotton from Egypt and sold it in northern Europe. It processed cowhides, turned coral into jewelry and bartered it for diamonds. &#x201c;During the nineteenth cent...</p><h2>NIV, Beautiful Word Bible, Large Print, Hardcover: 500 Full-Color Illustrated Verses</h2><p><p><strong>Be drawn into God&#x2019;s Word through a fresh, creative expression of the beautiful words of God.</strong></p><p>Crafted on high-quality paper and balanced with inspiring full-color art and blank space, the <em>NIV Beautiful Word</em><em>TM</em><em> Bible, Large Print </em>will encourage a deeper and more authentic quiet time.

What is defensible in it and what is to be rejected? Do we as human beings have no shared standards by which we can understand one another? Can we abstain from judging one another's practices? Do we truly have divergent views about what constitutes good and evil, virtue and vice, harm and welfare, dignity and humiliation, or is there some underlying commonality that trumps it all?</p><p>These questions turn up everywhere, from Montaigne's essay on cannibals, to the UN Declaration of Human Rights, to the debate over female genital mutilation. They become ever more urgent with the growth of mass immigration, the rise of religious extremism, the challenges of Islamist terrorism, the rise of identity politics, and the resentment at colonialism and the massive disparities of wealth and power between North and South. Are human rights and humanitarian interventions just the latest form of cultural imperialism? By what right do we judge particular practices as barbaric? Who are the real barbarians?</p><p>In this provocative new book, the distinguished social theorist Steven Lukes takes an incisive and enlightening look at these and other challenging questions and considers the very foundations of what we believe, why we believe it, and whether there is a profound discord between "us" and "them."</p></p><p><p><b>Steven Lukes</b> is the author of numerous books and articles about political and social theory, morality, relativism, Marxism, and power.

The very word inspires polemics that are sometimes passionate and often hostile. Relativism seems to be a threat to intellectual certainties, on the one hand, and to moral seriousness, on the other. Here are just two examples. Pope Benedict, on the eve of his election, proclaimed that we are &#x201c;moving toward a dictatorship of relativism which does not recognize anything as for certain and which has as its highest goal one&#x2019;s own ego and one&#x2019;s own desires.&#x201d;2&nbsp;And in his best-selling book,&nbsp;<i>The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today&#x2019;s Students</i>, the late Allan Bloom wrote that &#x201c;relativism has extinguished the real motive of education, the search for a good life.&#x201d;3Both these statements suggest that what their authors call &#x201c;relativism&#x201d; has already secured wide appeal, and both focus on&nbsp;<i>moral</i>&nbsp;relativism, which certainly does seem plausible and attractive to many people, even if they don&#x2019;t use, or even reject, the label. What is it that causes those who denounce it such concern? In this book I shall try to clarify just what is at issue here. What exactly does a relativist assert, and what is distinctive about moral relativism? What is it about moral relativism that both attracts and repels? What is defensible in it and what should be rejected?First we need to distinguish between relativism about knowledge, or cognitive relativism, and moral relativism, on which we will focus our attention.<i>Cognitive Relativism</i>Is what we can know determined by a world that is independent of us, or is it, in some sense, &#x201c;up to us&#x201d;? Immanuel Kant maintained that we cannot step outside the human standpoint&#x2014;the circle of our own conceptions, theories, and reasonings&#x2014;to a bare world as it is in itself, independent of them. Kant&#x2019;s philosophy was built on this unnerving thought, but Kant sought to defuse the threat. He used &#x201c;we&#x201d; inclusively to mean all of us human beings, together with any other being that humans could understand. So &#x201c;we,&#x201d; in this inclusive sense, are all in the same boat with respect to knowledge and reason. Moreover, there is no cause for alarming uncertainty about what we can know and how we should reason. After all, the only knowledge available to us has to be intelligible to us. So it must be framed within the pregiven categories (such as space, time, persons, and objects in causal relations with one another) that shape our thinking and make it possible. And since we are rational persons, how we reason is not up to us but set by the requirements of Reason (with a capital&nbsp;<i>R</i>).But Kant&#x2019;s reassurances were gradually swept away and the thought became more unnerving. Friederich Nietzsche made a first major breach by advancing what is sometimes called &#x201c;perspectivism&#x201d;&#x2014;writing that there is &#x201c;<i>only</i>&nbsp;a perspective seeing,&nbsp;<i>only</i>&nbsp;a perspective &#x2018;<i>knowing</i>&#x2019;&#x201d;4&#x2014;according to which what we know is guided, shaped, even constituted by our desires, our passions&#x2014;in short, our&nbsp;interests. There is no &#x201c;true world&#x201d; that is really objective but unknown to us humans. There are indefinitely many possible perspectives from which knowledge is to be had, and there is no prospect of their being brought to converge within a true, comprehensive theory of the world.This thought becomes fully relativist when the idea of perspectives is tied to particular groups within humanity. Now the idea is that potentially all our ideas and theories are to be seen as local cultural formations, rooted in and confined to particular times and places, and that there is no independent &#x201c;truth of the matter&#x201d; to decide among them. This may in turn suggest that we as human beings have no shared standards on the basis of which we can understand one other. Now there are multiple &#x201c;we&#x2019;s,&#x201d; each with &#x201c;our&#x201d; own standards of truth, reasoning, and morality. The term&nbsp;<i>we</i>&nbsp;is no longer inclusive but contrastive: it picks out&nbsp;<i>us</i>&nbsp;as opposed to others. As this idea spreads, Bernard Williams writes,<br>[m]oral claims, the humane disciplines of history and criticism, and natural science itself have come to seem to some critics not to command the reasonable assent of all human beings. They are seen rather as the products of groups within humanity expressing the perspectives of those groups. Some see the authority of supposedly rational discourse as itself barely authority, but rather a construct of social forces.In a further turn, reflections on this situation itself can lead to a relativism which steps back from all perspectives and sees them all at the same distance, all true, none true, each of them true for its own partisans.5<br>Not all relativists travel the full distance of this reckless and giddy journey. Those who do often insist on &#x201c;the socially constructed and politically contested nature of facts, theory, practices and power.&#x201d;6&nbsp;The very phrase &#x201c;social construction&#x201d;&#x2014;and, worse still, &#x201c;the social construction of reality&#x201d;&#x2014;has, for a while, had an intoxicating effect on thinkers in various social scientific disciplines. The effect was not to&nbsp;<i>refute</i>social scientists&#x2019; theories and explanations or to&nbsp;<i>unmask</i>&nbsp;ways in which their findings can serve socially or politically powerful interests, but rather to&nbsp;<i>undermine</i>&nbsp;the very idea that scientific explanations are superior to others. So, for example, an archaeologist working for the Zuni Indian tribe, who believe that their ancestors came from inside the earth into a world prepared for them by supernatural spirits, writes that science &#x201c;is just one of many ways of knowing the world&#x201d; and that the Zuni worldview is &#x201c;just as valid as the archaeological viewpoint of what prehistory is about.&#x201d; Another archaeologist, Dr. Zimmerman of the University of Iowa, explicitly rejects &#x201c;science as a privileged way of seeing the world.&#x201d;7&nbsp;And the anthropologist Renato Rosaldo views social scientists&#x2019; claims to&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;objectivity, neutrality and impartiality&#x201d;</i>&nbsp;as &#x201c;analytical postures developed during the colonial era&#x201d; which &#x201c;can no longer be sustained&#x201d;: they are &#x201c;arguably neither more nor less valid than those of more engaged, yet equally perceptive, knowledgeable social actors.&#x201d;8The way for such assertions was prepared by, among others, three thinkers, who raised questions about the objectivity of science itself in its very heartland, namely, natural science. One was Paul Feyerabend, self-described &#x201c;epistemological anarchist,&#x201d; who famously wrote in&nbsp;<i>Against Method</i>&nbsp;that &#x201c;science is much closer to myth than a scientific philosophy is prepared to admit. It is one of the many forms of thought that have been developed by man, and not necessarily the best. It is conspicuous, noisy, and impudent, but it is inherently superior only for those who have already decided in favour of a certain ideology, or who have accepted it without ever having examined its advantages and its limits.&#x201d;9&nbsp;A second was his fellow historian-philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn, whose enormously influential book&nbsp;<i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>10&nbsp;challenged the standard textbook picture of scientific progress cumulatively evolving toward the truth, suggesting instead that science proceeds through a succession of &#x201c;incommensurable&#x201d; paradigms, seen as constellations of group commitments. And the third is Bruno Latour, who engaged in anthropological studies of scientists&#x2019; &#x201c;laboratory life,&#x201d; claiming, for example that &#x201c;nature&#x201d; can never explain how a scientific controversy gets settled and proclaiming that &#x201c;[i]rrationality is always an accusation made by someone building a network over someone else who stands in the way.&#x201d;11&nbsp;No space here, it would seem, for the role of factual evidence or of reasoning in settling disputes or advancing scientific knowledge. (Interestingly, Kuhn never licensed and both Feyerabend and Latour subsequently distanced themselves from the extreme relativist conclusions others have drawn from their writings.12)The idea that facts, or indeed &#x201c;reality,&#x201d; are socially constructed is an intoxicating mix of three distinct ideas, as Ian Hacking has made clear in his book&nbsp;<i>The Social Construction of What?</i>13&nbsp;Each of these ideas is heady enough, and the first step to sobriety is to consider&nbsp;the plausibility of each in particular cases. (There is a difference, after all, between claiming that, say, quarks are socially constructed and claiming that attention deficit disorder is.) The first is the idea of&nbsp;<i>contingency</i>: the thought that our explanatory theories could have been quite otherwise&#x2014;so that, for example, there could have been an equally successful alternative physics in no sense equivalent to existing physics. The second is the idea of&nbsp;<i>nominalism:</i>&nbsp;the thought that our categories and classifications are not fixed by the structure of the world but by our linguistic conventions. And the third is the idea, sometimes called&nbsp;<i>externalism,</i>&nbsp;that we believe what we do, not because of the reasons that appear to justify what we believe, but because of factors such as the influence of the powerful or of social interests or of institutional imperatives or of social networks.

Lee, J.E.B. Stuart and Wade Hampton. The Scouts were stationed behind enemy lines on a permanent basis and provided critical military intelligence to their generals. They became proficient in &#34;unconventional&#34; warfare and emerged unscathed in so many close-combat actions that their foes grudgingly dubbed them Hampton&#39;s &#34;Iron Scouts.&#34; Author D.

Though documents surrounding the unit's origins are scarce, according to the author the Iron Scouts were a Lee-Stuart brainchild that was assigned to Wade Hampton to create, with most of the initial contingent of picked men coming from the 2nd South Carolina Cavalry (with many different units eventually contributing members). Formed in late 1862, just 72 men served in the ranks of the Iron Scouts over the 2+ years of its existence. In addition to an organization and service history narrative, the book also includes a roster with quite a bit of biographical detail for each trooper gathered from a variety of sources." <i> Civil War Books and Authors </i><br><br>"Thomas has done a superb job of scouring various sources to put together a history of a neglected branch of the Confederate army.

After Prussia&#x2019;s spectacular defeat of France, the coalescing of German states into a unified Germany, and Bismarck&#x2019;s declaration of the German Empire, Richard Wagner suddenly felt like a prophet whose predictions had come true before his eyes. At last the German culture he longed to enliven had a German state as grand as his own ambition.&nbsp;In the same period Wagner was deeply inspired by the works of Shakespeare, an influence that runs throughout this volume. The title essay, &#x201c;Actors and Singers,&#x201d; is one of Wagner&#x2019;s most deliberate and philosophical writings. He wrote, &#x201c;Art ceases, strictly speaking, to be Art from the moment it presents itself as Art to our reflecting consciousness.&#x201d; He described how the unconsciousness of art, and thus art&#x2019;s power, connected natural genius to cultivated traditions. German genius, however, still lacked its own traditions. Wagner aimed to provide them.&nbsp;Also included are Wagner&#x2019;s famous essay, &#x201c;Beethoven&#x201d;; his first publications concerning the nascent Bayreuth Festival Playhouse; his visionary &#x201c;The Destiny of Opera&#x201d;; and his letter to Friedrich Nietzsche responding to the publication of <i>The</i> <i>Birth of Tragedy</i>.&nbsp;This edition includes the full text of volume 5 of the translation of Wagner&#x2019;s works published in 1896 for the London Wagner Society.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Last of the Few: The Battle of Britain in the Words of the Pilots Who Won It</h2><p>After the fall of France in May 1940, the British Expeditionary Force was miraculously evacuated from Dunkirk. Britain now stood alone to face Hitler&#39;s inevitable invasion attempt. For the German Army to be landed across the Channel, Hitler needed mastery of the skies - the RAF would have to be broken - so every day, throughout the summer, German bombers pounded the RAF air bases in the southern counties. Greatly outnumbered by the Luftwaffe, the pilots of RAF Fighter Command scrambled as many as five times a day, and civilians watched skies criss-crossed with the contrails from the constant dogfights between Spitfires and Me-109s. Britain&#39;s very freedom depended on the outcome of that summer&#39;s battle. Britain&#39;s air defences were badly battered and nearly broken, but against all odds, &#39;The Few&#39;, as they came to be known, bought Britain&#39;s freedom - many with their lives. These are the personal accounts of the pilots who fought and survived that battle.

Probably because the noise had hardly died down before it started up again with the explosions at Messines, shortly to be followed by the even more horrible Third Ypres - remembered as Passchendaele - the Battle of Arras has not received the attention it deserves. Yet, as the author points out, on the basis of the daily casualty rate it was the most lethal and costly British offensive battle of the First World War. In the thirty-nine days that the battle lasted the average casualty rate was far higher than at either the Somme or Passchendaele. Jonathan Nicholls, in this his first book, gives the Battle of Arras its proper place in the annals of military history, enhancing his text with a wealth of eye-witness accounts. One is left in no doubt that the survivor who described it as &#39;the most savage infantry battle of the war&#39;, did not exaggerate.

In front of the main entrance of the London department store, the motorcycle exploded in a blast of blinding white light. In the tradition of Len Deighton, Jack Higgins, and Ken Follett, Stephen Leather&#39;s &#34;The Chinaman&#34; delivers jolt after jolt of suspense �- a novel of vivid characters, intense action and relentless excitement from the first page to the last. The only surviving members of Nguyen Ngoc Minh&#39;s family fell victims to the department store bomb. A North Vietnamese trained in guerrilla warfare, Nguyen had escaped to the south and fought with the U.S. Special Forces until the fall of Saigon. In London, he had found a peaceful new life.but now, his family&#39;s slaughter has aroused in the battered, slight survivor the passions of a warrior bent on revenge. The police and the politicians to whom Nguyen turns for help dismiss him as a bothersome &#34;Chinaman.&#34; But journalist Ian Wood sees the obdurate Nguyen as the key to his big story �- and gives him the name of a suspected terrorist leader. Belfast lawyer Liam Hennessy is one of the most powerful men in a terrorist network out of control; even he does not know who is behind the London bombings. When Nguyen unleashes a harrowing campaign of violence at his Irish countryside farm, Hennessey tries to make a secret deal with the British that may yield the terrorists&#39; identities. As the savage bombings continue in London, Hennessy&#39;s wife flees to her lover&#39;s arms; a traitor undergoes a brutal interrogation; the rogue terrorists prepare their most gruesome assault; and the Chinaman races toward a violent climax.

Agou's work has been published editorially in major magazines, exhibited in both solo and group exhibitions in Europe and the US and represented in numerous public collections, notably The Smithsonian Institution, The Museum of Fine Arts of Houston, The New York Public Library, The Akron Art Museum and Les Galeries Photo Fnac.Shot between 1997 and 2000, French photojournalist Agou's subway portraits stick to the gritty b&amp;w protocol set by generations before him and deliver satisfying set pieces. An exhausted Latino worker sprawled out on the steps in the heat, waiting interminably for the train; a sensitive looking Clark Kent type in madras shorts staring blankly out the window of a passing train; an emaciated nun dozing but alert; trash blowing above grates; the bulging stomach of a mid-level employee in outdated shirt and tie; a tangle of wires leading to an antiquated P.A. speaker&#x2014;it's all here, including what looks like a pool of blood on a concrete concourse. The printing of these 64 duotones is sharp, with a maximum of one photo per page and some spreads. As the publicity note states, New York City is considering banning "unauthorized" photography in the subway, so Agou's subject and style, which are commonplace now, may become rarer. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There is a double movement to this coming; both our active preparation to be ready for him and our patient waiting for the Lord to arrive in his own good time. There is also an art to this simultaneous preparation and waiting, and no one knows better than the beloved Mother Mary Francis how to encourage us in our attempts to master this art. <p>Meditating on passages from Scripture about the coming of the Messiah into the world and our hearts, Mother challenges us to persevere in overcoming our faults and keeping our eyes on the Lord who has called us to himself-for it is he, through the gifts of his grace, who will complete in us the work of sanctification which he has begun.</p><p>Though written for Advent, the wisdom of Mother Mary Francis collected by her sisters is profitable at any time because a Christian life is one of constant growth into the very likeness of God.</p></p><p><b>Mother Mary Francis, P.C.C.</b>, (1921-2006) was for more than forty years the abbess of the Poor Clare Monastery of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Roswell, New Mexico. She became recognized as an authoritative voice for the renewal of religious life through her many books, including <i>A Right to Be Merry, But I Have Called You Friends, </i>and <i>Anima Christi.</i>In these meditations, Mother Mary Francis teaches us that the liturgy keeps offering us precious insights that most of us do not perceive as precious jewels, for we have not learned the art of listening to the Divine voice speaking to us through the liturgy. All this is sketched with the powerful hand of someone who has lived it. ---Alice von Hildebrand<br><br>The Poor Clare Abbess opens her precious sanctuary, the inner life of her vocation, disclosing the simplicity of the Franciscan gifts for a life of prayer by artfully sharing meditations on the weeks of Advent preparing for Christmas. With wit and sometimes deft humor, she redefines perennial values through contemporary analogies. Anyone needing to be re-established in the essential goodness of our Catholic traditions will find these meditations healing and consoling.

Although this land was still in Mexican territory, the United States had gradually abandoned most of the diplomatic niceties regarding its boundaries with Mexico by that time.&nbsp;Abert set out from Bent&#x2019;s Fort to conduct a detailed reconnaissance. He possessed a great eye for detail, providing in his journal graphic descriptions of the birds, plants, and animals he encountered as well as clear depictions of the countryside. Moreover, Abert observed in great detail the Kiowas and Comanches who often approached his expedition to see if he and his men were the much hated &#x2018;Texans&#x2019; with whom they were at war.

Sotatsu is arrested, jailed, and interrogated&#x2014;but he refuses to speak. Even as his parents, brother, and sister come to visit him, even as his execution looms, and even as a young woman named Jito Joo enters his cell, he maintains his vow of silence.

He gives classes on lucid dreaming and lying at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p><p><b>A First Telling of the Story<br><br></b>Oda Sotatsu was a young man in October of 1977. He was in the twenty-ninth year of his life. He worked in an office, an import/export business owned by his uncle. They principally sold thread. To do this, they bought thread also. Mostly for Sotatsu it was buying and selling thread. He did not like it very much, but went about it without complaint. He lived alone, had no girlfriend, no pets. He had a basic education and a small circle of acquaintances. He appears to have been well thought of. He liked jazz and had a record player. He wore simple, muted clothing, ate most meals at home. The more passionately he felt about a subject, the less likely he would be to join a discussion. Many people knew him, and lived beside him, near him&#x2014;but few could say they had any sense of what he was really like. They had not suspected that he was really like anything. It seemed he merely was what he did: a quiet daily routine of work and sleep.<br>&nbsp;<br>The story of Oda Sotatsu begins with a confession that he signed.<br>&nbsp;<br>He had fallen in with a man named Kakuzo and a girl named Jito Joo. These were somewhat wild characters, particularly Sato Kakuzo. He was in trouble, or had been. People knew it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now this is what happened: somehow Kakuzo met Oda Sotatsu, and somehow he convinced him to sign a confession for a crime that he had not committed.<br>&nbsp;<br>That he should sign a confession for a crime that he did not commit is strange. It is hard to believe. Yet, he did in fact sign it. When I learned of these events, and when I researched them, I found that there was a reason he did so, and that reason is&#x2014;he was compelled to by a wager.<br>&nbsp;<br>There were several accounts of how that evening went. One was the version that had been in the newspapers. Another was a version told by Oda Sotatsu&#x2019;s family. Still a third was the version held to by Sato Kakuzo. This final version is stronger than the others for the reason that Kakuzo taped the proceedings and showed the tape to me. I have listened to it many times, and each time, I hear things that I have not heard before. One has the impression that one can know life, actual life, from its simulacrums by the fact that actual life constantly deceives and reveals, and is consistent in doing so. <br>&nbsp;<br>I will describe for you the events of that evening.<br><b><br><br>The Wager<br><br></b>When I listened to the tape, the conversation was, in places, difficult to make out. The music was loud. As the night wore on, the party drank and spoke quite rapidly. In general, the atmosphere was that of a bar. Someone (Joo?) repeatedly gets up, leaves, returns, scraping her chair loudly against the wooden floor. They spoke inconsequentially for about forty minutes, and then they reached the matter of the wager. <br>&nbsp;<br>Kakuzo led into it quietly. He spoke fluidly and described a sort of comradeship that they shared, the three of them. He acted as though they were all fed up with life. Joo and he, he said, had been doing things to try to escape this feeling. One of those things was to wager on cards, in a private game between the two of them. He said when he would lose, he would cut himself. Or Joo would cut herself, if she should lose. He said they went from that to other things, to forcing each other to do things, in order to feel alive again. But it all revolved around the wagering, around letting life hang in a balance. Did Sotatsu not think that was fascinating? Was he in no way stirred to try it? <br>&nbsp;<br>All night, they were at him, Joo and Kakuzo, and finally, they convinced him. In fact, they had chosen him because he had appeared to them as someone who might be convinced, who could be convinced of such a thing. And indeed, it proved true; they were able to make him join their game. <br>&nbsp;<br>He and Kakuzo made a wager. The wager was that the loser, whoever he was, would sign a confession. Kakuzo had brought the confession. He set it out on the table. The loser would sign it, and Joo would bring it to the police station. All that one could feel in life would be gathered up into this single moment when the wager went forward and one&#x2019;s entire life hung on the flip of a card. Kakuzo had brought the cards as well, and they sat there on the table beside the confession. <br>&nbsp;<br>The music in the bar was loud. Oda Sotatsu&#x2019;s life was difficult and had not yielded to him the things he had hoped for. He liked and respected both Kakuzo and Joo and they were bent entirely on him, and on his doing of this thing. This is how it turned out: Oda Sotatsu wagered with Sato Kakuzo. He lost the wager. He took a pen and he signed the confession, there on the table. Joo took it with her and she and Kakuzo left the bar. Oda went home to his small apartment. Whether he slept or not, we do not know.</p></p><h2>Nigel Short&#39;s Best Games (The Batsford Chess Library)</h2><p>Profiles Britain&#39;s top chess master, Nigel Short, and analyzes twelve of his most outstanding games</p><p></p><h2>Great Black Entertainers: Paper Dolls in Full Color</h2><p>Detailed authentic depictions of 10 great stars, Bert Williams to Louis Armstrong, in celebrated roles, concert performances.

He arrived in New York in 1900 and covered the city's waterfront until his death in 1929. Levick had a great eye and an intrepid approach, framing strongly patterned compositions from deck and shore, always on the lookout for what Lopate calls any "anecdotal possibility." Here in sharply focused, thrillingly vibrant black-and-white photographs are sailors, upper-class passengers and exhausted immigrants, and dockworkers loading and unloading cargo--bananas, sulfur, lumber, cattle--as well as magnificent yachts, ferries, barges, luxury liners, fishing boats, and battleships. Here, in short, is an elegant visual record of the busiest port in the world in its heyday, feeding a robust and burgeoning metropolis. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In a world that has been redefined by a proliferation of communication networks and by a progressive erasure of borders, Mutations reflects on the transformations that these accelerating processes inflict on our environment, and on the spaces in which architecture can still operate. Organized as a heavily illustrated atlas/survey of contemporary urban landscapes, the first section of this exhaustive and essential book begins with revealing data on global urbanization, juxtaposed with a series of essays on the changing environment and economy of today&#39;s metropolis. The rest of the book is devoted to a selection of groundbreaking studies by some of the central figures in contemporary architectural urbanism, including the Pearl River Delta in Southeast Asia, a project of the Harvard Project on the City, directed by Rem Koolhaas; &#39;&#39;Uncertain States of Europe,&#39;&#39; a project by Stefano Boeri and Multiplicity; a survey of American cities by Sanford Kwinter and Daniela Fabricius; and a study of Lagos, Nigeria--one of Africa&#39;s largest cities--by the Harvard Project.</p><p>"A city is a plane of tarmac with some red hot spots of intensity," Rem Koolhaas, the pathbreaking architect and author of such semiotically seminal books as <i>Delirious New York</i> and the more recent <i>S, M, L, XL</i>, remarked in 1969. More than 30 years later, there are more of those hot spots around the world than ever, and they're getting hotter every day. Globalization, standardization, and the high-speed innovations of our current information age are transforming urban centers from London to Los Angeles to Lagos, and more places are becoming more urban, and at a faster pace, than ever before.<p> <i>Mutations</i> is an eye-popping atlas-cum-analysis of this new urbanization, and much of it is composed of essays and meditations (from a variety of contributors) on the 21st-century international City (often un-)Beautiful. Most of them are written in language that will be familiar to readers of Koolhaas's past books: in other words, dense, abstract, and chock-full of references to Foucault, Deleuze, and Guattari. If you like that sort of deconstructivist yammering, great; if not, the major small-type essays are best sampled (or, better, skimmed) one at a time, interspersed with the many other more accessible elements of the book that truly do add up to a vivid and fascinating mosaic of postmodern urbanism. </p><p> From Koolhaas and Harvard Design School's Project on the City come two engrossing and wholly straightforward explorations: one of the Pearl River Delta, which China has designated as a zone of unrestricted capitalist experimentation, and whose five major urban centers have consequently exploded overnight in all sorts of instructive and often frightening ways; and another of the chaotic, congested and <i>Blade Runner</i>esque megalopolis of Lagos, Nigeria, whose patterns of growth, housing, and commerce defy all conventional wisdom on how cities should develop. There's also a bounty of excellent (and often astonishing) statistics on all aspects of urban growth; a "snapshots" section of phenomena from cities all over the globe; a completely spot-on (and unintentionally funny) analysis of the evolution of shopping as the last truly unifying urban public activity (and the subject of Koolhaas's next full-scale book); and a trenchant look at Kosovo as ground zero in the first major war of the Internet age. (It should be noted that there's a separate section on the U.S., which with all its soulless, tacky consumerist excess gets the drubbing it usually can expect from the European intelligentsia, although the irony here is that more and more of newly urban Europe is starting to look like newly urban America.) </p><p> The exhibit-quality photography throughout is great, and, as you could expect from this unofficial successor to <i>S, M, L, XL</i>, the design is satisfyingly outr�, right down to its post-Warholian plastic yellow easy-wipe cover with glued-on mousepad. But for all of <i>Mutations</i>'s rich trove of facts and insights, and the impression that its high-tech design gives of an ironic embrace of the new urbanization, its deeper tone is one of disappointment and loss. The spirit of Jane Jacobs resides here, with all its yearning for the quirky, quaint beauty of human-scaled townhouses and shops, sidewalks and byways, and for the precorporatized glamour of grand old towns like New York, London, Paris, and Shanghai, before such metallic nouveau hubs as Atlanta and Kuala Lumpur were ever on the world-commerce map. <i>Mutations</i> was written and compiled largely by architects, after all, who hate ugliness as much as the next guy, whatever they may claim otherwise; its precisely for that reason that this densely absorbing new compendium betrays its wistfulness as often as it promotes its own air of cool, ethnographic bemusement. <i>--Timothy Murphy</i></p>The city is in the process of mutation as globalization and urbanization transform both the environment and traditional architectural forms. &#34;Mutations&#34; presents an atlas of new urban spaces.

This book makes a contribution to the dialogue between religion and science, and presents the explanatory patterns that offer scientists, philosophers, and artists a philosophical unity on the topic.</p><p>Artigas takes on the ambitious task of building a philosophical "bridge between science and religion" along pragmatic and humanistic lines. A professor of natural science at the University of Navarra (Spain), the author intends this book to be an expanded version of a previous project, and it shows. The leisurely pace and references to a generous collection of authors and arguments give the book an unnecessarily academic tone, considering that the main argument is quite simple and informal. Unlike many bridge-builders attempting to mediate between science and religion, Artigas has little hope that direct "dialogue" is going to accomplish much, barring a major compromise (or confusion) in scientific or religious methodology. He focuses instead on the presuppositions of science, viewed not as metaphysical postulates but as "states of affairs" pragmatically assumed whenever science is done--the sense in which going fishing "presupposes" that there are some fish in the lake. Artigas's discussion of scientific presuppositions turns up some of the usual suspects (an ordered universe, competent human rationality, value commitments to truth and some idea of social improvement through science), but he gives them an unusual treatment by reflecting on how "feedback" from scientific progress informs and vindicates these presuppositions. As portrayed here, the philosophical stance presupposed by science is actually a liberal humanism set in an orderly and apparently purposeful universe, something not unlike the philosophy called for by Pope John Paul II in Fides et Ratio. Coincidence? Perhaps, though as Artigas's mentor says, coincidence may just be God's way of remaining anonymous. (Apr.) <p></p><p>Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>&#34;Professor Artigas has raised the level of the contemporary debate on the relation between science and religion and provided a sure guide to their complexities.

A year later he laid siege to the city and destroyed it. The treasure was never recovered; presumably it lies under Mexico City, built on Tenochtitlan's ruins and the filled-in lake bed. The complicated, eventful story is dramatically (and even poetically) condensed and retold, though background information may be needed to explain both sides' motivations and maneuvers. Likewise, the striking authenticity of the ink-and-watercolor illustrations may not be fully appreciated without some understanding of the conventions of Aztec glyphs and codex art. Intriguing details that may need elucidation include the floating gardens (``chinampas''), priests smeared with black ointment, and smoke belching from the volcano Popocatapetl. Human sacrifice is mentioned but not illustrated, nor is its importance in Aztec life (or the importance of warfare to secure sacrificial victims) emphasized. Excellent as a supplement to instructional units and as an introduction to Aztec art. (Nonfiction/Picture book. 6-9) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

McCloy &amp; The Making of the American Establishment</h2><p>The biography of an ultimate self-made aristocrat tells how a poor kid from Philadelphia climbed to the highest rungs of the world&#39;s legal, corporate, diplomatic, and political ladders. 12,500 first printing.</p><p>Kai Bird is the co-author with Martin J. Sherwin of the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, <i>American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer</i> (2005), which also won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography. His other books include <i>The Chairman: John J. McCloy, the Making of the American Establishment</i> (1992) and <i>The Color of Truth: McGeorge Bundy &amp; William Bundy, Brothers in Arms </i>(1998). Bird&#x2019;s many honors include fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, the German Marshall Fund, and the Rockefeller Foundation. A contributing editor of <i>The Nation</i>, he lives in Kathmandu, Nepal, with his wife and son.In a 1962 spoof for Esquire, Richard Rovere quoted John Kenneth Galbraith as deeming John J. McCloy ``chairman of the US Establishment''--but McCloy has never been the subject of a full- dress biography. Here, Bird (a contributing editor of The Nation) fills this void with an evenhanded and wonderfully readable account of the public man that also sheds light on the meritocracy whose dedication to principles beyond partisanship still gives it incalculable influence over a presumptively democratic polity. An ambitious, industrious overachiever who made his way from the wrong side of the tracks in Philadelphia through Amherst and Harvard Law School to international eminence, McCloy was notable more for analytic acuity than great brilliance. The upwardly mobile attorney nonetheless left his mark wherever he went. During WW II, for example, the globe-trotting McCloy was Henry Stimson's top aide at the War Department. He later headed the World Bank during its formative years and was High Commissioner of occupied Germany, moving on to the chairmanship of Chase Manhattan. Though a staunch Republican, he served as an advisor to JFK, LBJ, and their successors, while remaining a leading light of the Council on Foreign Relations--an establishment citadel if ever there was one. Although a pillar of rectitude, the pragmatic McCloy did not eschew expedients. He played a key role in the internment of Japanese- Americans after Pearl Harbor, for instance, and granted clemency to scores of convicted Nazis during his tenure in Berlin. When he died early in 1989, a few weeks short of 94, however, McCloy was fittingly eulogized for his substantive contributions to the public good. An impressive narrative history that records a consequential individual's shortcomings without tarnishing his accomplishments. Despite a paucity of personal detail, the absorbing text (ten years in preparation) will likely be the definitive life story for decades to come. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It was a landscape never encountered before by another European. Kelsey has been lauded as "first in the west" and the "discoverer of the Canadian prairies." But these accolades overlook the simple fact that any European and later Canadian activity in what would become the future province of Saskatchewan was entirely dependent on the goodwill and cooperation of the indigenous peoples of the region. After all, Kelsey had to be taken inland. He was a passenger, not a pathfinder. </p><p> <i>A World We Have Lost</i> examines the early history of Saskatchewan through an Aboriginal and environmental lens. Indian and mixed-descent peoples played leading roles in the story -- as did the land and climate. Despite the growing British and Canadian presence, the Saskatchewan country remained Aboriginal territory. The region's peoples had their own interests and needs and the fur trade was often peripheral to their lives. Indians and Metis peoples wrangled over territory and resources, especially bison, and were not prepared to let outsiders control their lives, let alone decide their future. Native-newcomer interactions were consequently fraught with misunderstandings, sometimes painful difficulties, if not outright disputes. By the early nineteenth century, a distinctive western society had emerged in the North-West -- one that was challenged and undermined by the takeover of the region by a young dominion of Canada. Settlement and development was to be rooted in the best features of Anglo-Canadian civilization, including the white race. By the time Saskatchewan entered confederation as a province in 1905, the world that Kelsey had encountered during his historic walk on the northern prairies had become a world we have lost. </p></p><p><br>2016 Governor General's Literary Awards winner in the adult non-fiction category<blockquote> <p>Jury Statement<br>"From its first page, Bill Waiser's <i>A World We Have Lost: Saskatchewan Before 1905</i> surprises the reader with its reconsideration of Canada.

WARREN ZEVON WROTE A TRIBUTE SONG. </b>Sylvester Stallone produced his life story as a movie of the week. In the 1980s, Ray &#x201c;Boom Boom&#x201d; Mancini wasn&#x2019;t merely the lightweight champ. An adoring public considered him a national hero, the <i>real </i>Rocky. <br><br>From the mobbed-up steel city of Youngstown, Ohio, Mancini was cast as the savior of a sport: a righteous kid in a corrupt game, symbolically potent and demographically perfect, the last white ethnic. He fought for those left behind in busted-out mill towns across America. But most of all, he fought for his father. Lenny Mancini&#x2014;the <i>original </i>Boom Boom, as he was called&#x2014;had been a lightweight contender himself. But the elder Mancini&#x2019;s dream ended on a battlefield in November 1944, when fragments from a German mortar shell nearly killed him. Almost four decades later, Ray promised to win the title his father could not. What came of that vow was a feel-good fable for network television. <br><br>But it all came apart November 13, 1982, in a brutal battle at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Mancini&#x2019;s obscure Korean challenger, Duk Koo Kim, went down in the 14th round and never regained consciousness. Three months later, Kim&#x2019;s despondent mother took her own life. The deaths would haunt Ray and ruin his carefully crafted image, suddenly transforming boxing&#x2019;s All-American Boy into a pariah. <br><br>Now, thirty years after that nationally televised bout, Mark Kriegel finally uncovers the story&#x2019;s full dimensions. In tracking the Mancini and Kim families across generations, Kriegel exacts confessions and excavates mysteries&#x2014;from the killing of Mancini&#x2019;s brother to the fate of Kim&#x2019;s son. In scenes both brutal and tender, the narrative moves from Youngstown to New York, Vegas to Seoul, Reno to Hollywood, where the inevitably romantic <i>idea </i>of a fighter comes up against reality. <br><br>With the vivid style and deep reporting that have earned him renown as a biographer, Kriegel has written a fast-paced epic. <i>The Good Son </i>is an intimate history, a saga of fathers and fighters, loss and redemption.</p><p><b>Mark Kriegel </b>is the author of two critically acclaimed bestsellers, <i>Namath: A Biography</i> and <i>Pistol: The Life of Pete Maravich</i>. He is a veteran columnist and a commentator for the NFL Network. He lives with his daughter, Holiday, in Santa Monica, California.The Good Son Chapter 1 | Lenny Mancino<p></p> <br>Not long after his release from prison, Nick Mancino pulled aside his stocky ten-year-old son, Lenny:<br> <br>&#x201c;I have to go,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go with you,&#x201d; said the boy.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Nick. &#x201c;You have to stay here and take care of your mother.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lenny cried all that day and through the night. He cried so much that by the next morning, he knew he&#x2019;d never cry again.<br> <br>Nicola Mancino, son of Leonardo Mancino, of the Sicilian fishing village of Bagheria, left his ancestral home in the summer of 1913 and arrived at Ellis Island aboard the SS Palermo1 on September 5. He was eighteen, and slightly built at five foot two. After assuring the immigration officer he could both read and write, Mancino, a surname that translates as &#x201c;lefty&#x201d; or &#x201c;southpaw,&#x201d; was designated a &#x201c;labourer&#x201d; in the ship&#x2019;s manifest. With twenty-five dollars left, he was headed for the stretch of mill towns that pocked the land from western Pennsylvania to northeast Ohio.<br> <br>Youngstown, Ohio, the city in which he would settle, was home to U.S. Steel&#x2019;s Ohio Works, Truscon Steel, and the Youngstown Sheet and Tube on the east side. Trumbull Steel, eventually absorbed by Republic Iron &amp; Steel, was in nearby Warren. Not long after Mancino&#x2019;s arrival, the Mahoning Valley had become second only to Pittsburgh2 in the production of pig iron, those rectangular ingots liquefied in a furnace to make steel.<br> <br>The by-products of such mass production included slag heaps and a permanent cloud of smoke and soot hovering about six thousand feet above the city. Pilots landing in Youngstown3 typically did so with dirty faces. There were also regular bouts of industrial violence. For example, shortly after 4 P.M., on January 7, 1916, a single revolver shot from a crowd of well-armed, though not sober, picketers elicited a volley of rifle fire from guards stationed at Sheet and Tube&#x2019;s Poland Avenue entrance.<br> <br>&#x201c;What followed,&#x201d; according to one account, &#x201c;was sheer anarchy4&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the torch was put to building after building by a frenzied mob that poured gasoline on the fires to intensify the flames. Building fronts were battered in to provide draft to speed the blaze.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Not until 2,100 infantrymen and machine gunners were brought in toward morning was anything like order restored.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>On December 12, 19175, at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church, Nick took a wife. Annie Cannazzaro was American by birth, but her family also hailed from the village of Bagheria. Her mustachioed, broad-faced father, Beneditto, drove a horse-drawn cart bearing fruits and vegetables. She grew up with brothers named Michael, John, and Paul, and an older sister, Margaret, at 410 Lansing Avenue, on the east side, where children were bathed in a zinc basin in the kitchen. Annie was fifteen.<br> <br>Though the groom is again described as a laborer in their marriage license application, Nick would soon discern new and more profitable opportunities. The Volstead Act was passed in 1919, the same year his son Lenny was born in the Cannazzaro home on Lansing Avenue. Better known as Prohibition, it would prove a windfall for men with the inclination and balls to violate it.<br> <br>Youngstown&#x2019;s immigrant classes, most of them from southern and central Europe, didn&#x2019;t share the Anglo-Saxon concept of vice. They played the numbers, known locally as the bug. They played a dice game of Turkish origin called barbut. And they drank. In 1910, a city with a population of 79,066 had 324 grocery stores6 and 345 saloons. By 1930, ten thousand gallons7 of illegal beer were being brewed each day in Youngstown.<br> <br>The typical mill worker did twelve-hour shifts8, six days per week, at twenty cents per hour. Strikes were periodic occurrences, like changing seasons. Hence, it didn&#x2019;t take much for Nick to figure he&#x2019;d do better as a bootlegger. Not only would the new family man have money in his pocket, he&#x2019;d have respect.<br> <br>Family photographs show a man unlike his Cannazzaro in-laws: no pork-pie hat, no rolled up sleeves, no work boots. Nick Mancino has the unmistakable air, by stance, demeanor, and attire, of a padrone. His suit is three pieces and well tailored. His tie is fastened by a stickpin. His hands are clasped behind his back, his gaze calm but unnaturally direct.<br> <br>One can imagine what an outsized presence Nick Mancino was to his son. Even as an adult himself, Lenny would often remind his own children. &#x201c;Grandpa Nick,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say, wagging his finger, &#x201c;what a great man he was.&#x201d; On the east side, there was little stigma making a living from liquor or numbers. The only shame was in doing it dishonorably. Nick&#x2019;s progeny would take great pride in the fact that he never snitched.<br> <br>There were two kinds of illicit activities in Youngstown: those committed under the aegis of mafia interests in Pittsburgh or Cleveland, each of those cities being approximately 75 miles away. Nick was affiliated with the Cleveland crew, which could count on him for months at a time of reliably discreet incarceration. If only his young bride had been so loyal.<br> <br>In 1929, upon his last release, he&#x2019;d learned that Annie, variously described as &#x201c;a free-spirit,&#x201d; &#x201c;kind of a flapper type,&#x201d; and &#x201c;one of those women who liked to party,&#x201d; had become involved with another dapper man. His name was Valentine Pavone, better known as Slick, sometimes known as Slick Marino. Slick wore suits and ties and kept his hair parted and plastered back like one of the Dorsey brothers. For an aspiring patriarch like Nick, Annie&#x2019;s dalliance was an intolerable blow, the resulting complications and shame outweighing even the tearful supplications of his now-ten-year-old son who begged him to stay.<br> <br>Lenny never spoke of the circumstances that led to his dad&#x2019;s departure, at least not to any of his pals at Gumbo&#x2019;s pool room or the Pearl Street Mission or the bare-ass beach, as it was called, down by Jackson Hollow. All they knew is every once in a while he&#x2019;d go off to Buffalo to visit, as John Congemi, a friend of Lenny&#x2019;s, put it, &#x201c;his real father.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My father was basically a bootlegger in Youngstown and came to Buffalo to work in the same capacity, probably numbers, too,&#x201d; says Vincent Mancino, the first son of Nick&#x2019;s second marriage. &#x201c;He used to always say the judges were his biggest customers. Anyway, once the country went back to drinking, he went into construction.&#x201d;<br> <br>Neither the separation nor his father&#x2019;s new family did anything to diminish him in Lenny&#x2019;s eyes. If anything, the boy became more awestruck by the great man. &#x201c;Lenny loved my father more than anything else,&#x201d; recalls his stepbrother.<br> <br>Meanwhile, custody of Lenny was effectively awarded to a committee of Cannazzaros: mother, grandparents, aunts, and uncles, the most memorable of them then known on the east side as &#x201c;Firpo.&#x201d; Paulie Cannazzaro&#x2019;s namesake was Luis Firpo, the Wild Bull of the Pampas. Famous for knocking Jack Dempsey through the ropes in their 1923 title bout at the Polo Grounds, the real Firpo was six foot two and a half. Uncle Paulie was about the same, another heavyweight, and caught rail at Truscon Steel, literally catching pieces of railroad track as they came off the line. If any man were naturally suited for such a vocation, it would be Firpo, whose nephews would recall his hands the size of baseball mitts9. He could hold a gallon jug of wine upside down, his meaty fingers like clamps around the bottle&#x2019;s circumference.<br> <br>As generous as he was gregarious, the bachelor Firpo would treat the Cannazzaro children to haircuts, ice-cream cones, and cherry sodas. In particularly rough times, he would show up in his Buick with a week&#x2019;s worth of groceries, declaring he had just hit the bug.<br> <br>Yes, Firpo, known to sleep off a hard night in the pool room on Albert Street, was always amenable to a sporting proposition. Once the Depression arrived, he even volunteered his services as de facto street-corner matchmaker.<br> <br>&#x201c;My nephew will fight your boy,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say.<br> <br>&#x201c;They got a kick out of it,&#x201d; says Congemi, who recalls Firpo among the fraternity of older brothers who used to make the kids fight.<br> <br>My boy against yours. How much?<br> <br>&#x201c;The boys weren&#x2019;t even mad at each other,&#x201d; says Congemi.<br> <br>How much?<br> <br>Sensing reluctance or poor odds, Firpo would hype the wager himself, raking his huge paw across Lenny&#x2019;s mouth.<br> <br>Lenny could feel his face redden, as if it were on fire.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; said Firpo. &#x201c;The kid don&#x2019;t even cry.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>In May 1932, Mayor Joseph Heffernan described Youngstown&#x2019;s plight in the Atlantic Monthly. &#x201c;The Hungry City,&#x201d; as the piece was titled, cited the &#x201c;hundreds of homeless men crowded into the municipal incinerator, where they found warmth even though they had to sleep on heaps of garbage.&#x201d; It closed with a mention of Charles Wayne, fifty-seven, father of ten and a hot mill worker at Republic Steel, who &#x201c;stood on the Spring Common bridge this morning&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. took off his coat, folded it carefully, and had jumped into the swirling Mahoning River.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We were about to lose our home,&#x201d;10 sobbed Mrs. Wayne.<br> <br>By 1933, a third of Youngstown&#x2019;s workforce11 was unemployed. It is unknown whether Lenny figured in this tally, but at fourteen, his formal education had already come to an end. The family account would have him advancing as far as the fifth grade at Lincoln Park Elementary School. It wasn&#x2019;t unusual for a child of the Depression to be found hanging around on the streets of Youngstown. The United States Bureau of Education would issue a scathing report12 on the local school system, detailing a plague of inefficiency, mismanagement, poorly trained teachers, and substandard curricula.<br> <br>Diversions were plenty for truants on the east side of Youngstown. Lenny spent most of his days helping his grandfather on the horse-drawn wagon, selling fruits, vegetables, milk, and probably a little bit of hooch. His idle hours might be spent watching the dice games and high rollers who came to the Albert Street pool room all the way from Newcastle, or to watch a fight (there was always a fight in Youngstown) at the Rayen-Wood Auditorium. He could raid the local farms for apples and pears or could hang out at the Royal Oaks, the diner on Lansing Avenue. Or he might play football for the Pioneers, a team organized by one of the many local missions.<br> <br>But Lenny, who&#x2019;d grow to a height charitably listed as five foot two, wasn&#x2019;t much good at football or baseball. His true talent had been discerned early on by Uncle Firpo. &#x201c;He was so tough that nobody wanted to fight him,&#x201d; says Congemi, recalling an afternoon at the pool hall. &#x201c;My brother Dukie comes in and says three colored guys were giving him a hard time by the Royal Oaks. Lenny says, &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x2019; He lays all three of those colored guys out.&#x201d;<br> <br>More than seven decades later, Congemi contemplates his own fists, now gnarled with age, in wonder of Lenny&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Man, he had clubs.&#x201d;<br> <br>Unlike other Depression-era dropouts, he already had his destination clearly marked, a vocation, even a calling. Lenny Mancino began his amateur career as a flyweight, having to eat a bunch of bananas just to make the 108 pound minimum. &#x201c;My mother would hand make13 my trunks,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say, recalling the diminutive stature that belied his natural ferocity. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t get a pair of ready-mades.&#x201d; By 1936, his physical virtues had become more apparent. Broad, stocky, vigorous, and durable, he earned some local repute as a featherweight in the Ohio Golden Gloves tournament.<br> <br>Lenny could punch, especially to the body, but his skills were less impressive than his desire. Lenny&#x2019;s inclination&#x2014;unnatural even by fighter&#x2019;s standards&#x2014;was to literally push through pain and brutality, to always move forward.<br> <br>Talent is honed by circumstance, of course. Deprivation breeds pugilists. In that respect, it was an advantage to come of age in the Hungry City. What&#x2019;s more, as every fighter must drink from a reservoir of untold rage, the Oedipal drama didn&#x2019;t hurt Lenny, either. By the mid-thirties, Slick fancied himself Youngstown&#x2019;s most dapper boxing trainer, insisting on coat and tie even in a fighter&#x2019;s corner. In fact, he was a beater who treated Annie as an opponent.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lenny&#x2019;s mother was nice looking,&#x201d; recalls Congemi. &#x201c;Slick used to give her a hard time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;An ex-pug with a short man&#x2019;s complex,&#x201d; says Lenny&#x2019;s cousin, Benny D&#x2019;Amato. &#x201c;One of the meanest men I ever met.&#x201d;<br> <br>As Lenny himself would look back and say: &#x201c;I should&#x2019;ve killed the sonofabitch when I had the chance.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>The summer of 1937 saw greater Youngstown become a battlefield in an industrial war, known as the Little Steel Strike. About thirty-two thousand workers went out against local producers like Republic and Youngstown Sheet and Tube, both of which had been hiring armed guards14 and stockpiling munitions in anticipation of the riot that finally broke out June 19. That&#x2019;s when police opened fire at a crowd of picketers outside Republic&#x2019;s Stop Five gate. Casualties included15 two dead strikers and twenty-three wounded. A month later, Ohio&#x2019;s governor called in the National Guard.<br> <br>As Lenny&#x2019;s pal Red Delquadri16 would recall, the fix was in: &#x201c;The National Guard was there in the street to keep the workers from going after the scabs. They were working for the company.&#x201d;<br> <br>It would be another four years before the Roosevelt Administration could compel Little Steel to recognize the unions. Meanwhile, with no real work to be had, Lenny would find work under the auspices of another presidential initiative, the Civilian Conservation Corps, a public works program for unemployed, unmarried, and unskilled men between eighteen and twenty-six. For a standard wage of thirty dollars a month&#x2014;twenty-five17 dollars of which was sent back to the enrollee&#x2019;s family&#x2014;Lenny lied about his age and signed on in Shreve, Ohio.<br> <br>The new conscript in Roosevelt&#x2019;s war on poverty was sixteen and barely one hundred pounds. After a year or so, he was transferred to Ely, Nevada, Indian Springs Camp, Company 2532, an outfit charged with the construction of cattle fences for the Department of the Interior&#x2019;s Division of Grazing. He worked mostly as a cook.18 Photographs taken at the camp show Lenny holding a shovel at the base of a mountain, or posing in the scrub with the bill of his cap turned up at a jaunty angle. In each, he smiles for the camera: a short, thick-set teenager on the verge of manhood.<br> <br>&#x201c;We used to call him bear,&#x201d; says George DeLost, another member of Company 2532 by way of Youngstown. &#x201c;He was like a little bear.&#x201d;<br> <br>But that grinning, cublike quality could disappear at the slightest sign of a threat, a confrontation, or unwanted authority. &#x201c;He would fight anybody,&#x201d; says DeLost. &#x201c;Like one night, we was at this place called the Copper Club in Ely, and they had one of those hillbilly bands there. They had a big bass drum, one of those you hit with your foot.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, during the intermission some of us guys were monkeying around with it, and some big, tall hillbilly said something to Lenny. Like, &#x2018;get away from those instruments.&#x2019; So Lenny puts his foot righ...</p><h2>The Mother&#39;s Wisdom Deck: A 52-Card Inspiration Deck with Guidebook</h2><p>Moms always appreciate some loving guidance, wisdom, and support&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;ll find in this beautiful kit.

R.H.H. � AudioFile 2007, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Parables of Jesus: Lessons in Life from the Master Teacher</h2><p>Jesus Christ was the world&#39;s greatest teacher, and His teaching is still with us today in His parables. Eternal and heavenly truths are taught by means of these vivid, everyday stories that appeal to everyone. The parables of Jesus Christ have long challenged expositors, for in their simple form profound truths have been revealed. But the very simplicity of the parable form can be deceptive snare to interpreters. Instead of considering the context in which the parables arose and the background against which they were spoken, many have pressed the parables to teach viewpoints that were in their minds as interpreters but that did not originate in the text itself. In THE PARABLES OF JESUS, J. Dwight Pentecost takes a balanced, sane, and systematic approach. He describes the setting of each parable, that is, the context in which it is spoken and the background against which it was delivered. Pentecost then explains the problem or question each parable addresses and the solution it contains. Since the parables were primarily designed to instruct, emphasis is placed on the teaching rather than on the application. Here is J. Dwight Pentecost, expositor and teacher, at his best.</p><p>(1915-2014) J. Dwight Pentecost was distinguished professor of Bible exposition, emeritus, at Dallas Theological Seminary. He earned a B.A. from Hampden-Sydney College, and both a Th.M. and Th.D. from Dallas Theological Seminary.

For the miraculous reality that exists inside its boundaries demands energy&#x2014;energy drawn from everything outside those boundaries: from planets, stars, galaxies . . . from everything that lives.<br><br>Meanwhile, the parallel story of Edeard, the Waterwalker&#x2014;as told through a series of addictive dreams communicated to the gaiasphere via Inigo, the First Dreamer&#x2014;continues to unfold. But now the inspirational tale of this idealistic young man takes a darker and more troubling turn as he finds himself faced with powerful new enemies&#x2014;and temptations more powerful still.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With time running out, a repentant Inigo must decide whether to release Edeard&#x2019;s final dream: a dream whose message is scarcely less dangerous than the pilgrimage promises to be. And Araminta must choose whether to run from her unwanted responsibilities or face them down, with no guarantee of success or survival. But all these choices may be for naught if the monomaniacal Ilanthe, leader of the breakaway Accelerator Faction, is able to enter the Void. For it is not paradise she seeks there, but dominion.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Peter F. Hamilton is the author of numerous novels, including <b>The Dreaming Void,</b><i>Fallen Dragon,</i> Judas Unchained, Pandora&#x2019;s Star, and the acclaimed epic Night&#x2019;s Dawn trilogy (<i>The Reality Dysfunction, The Neutronium Alchemist</i>, and <i>The Naked God</i>). He lives with his family in England.As the story of the Void draws to a close, Hamilton takes up an extraordinary number of threads. Araminta, who has evaded pursuit thus far, comes back from the Silfen paths with a risky plan. Earth, and therefore ANA, is trapped behind a force field. Ilanthe, aims to fuse with the Void and create her own twisted utopia. Gore Burnelli and the Delivery Man seek out the Anomine&#x2019;s means of transcendence. Edeard, in Inigo&#x2019;s dreams, finally gets it right, and Querencia is fulfilled. Inigo and Araminta are finally brought together at the Spike. Inigo at last reveals his final dream, of Querencia after Edeard&#x2019;s ascension. Paula Myo and the Cat finally square off in an epic battle. While Living Dream adherents plan their pilgrimage, others&#x2014;including the Raiel&#x2014;plan their flight from this galaxy, and some will fight to the very end. Eventually, the scattered threads join in the Heart of the Void, where the truth about Makkrathan&#x2019;s origins and the Void itself is revealed. It&#x2019;s an altogether satisfying conclusion to the epic, and one of Hamilton&#x2019;s strongest outings yet: a spectacular space opera. --Regina Schroeder</p><h2>The Eastern Front 1914&#x2013;1920: From Tannenberg to the Russo-Polish War (History of WWI)</h2><p>The length of the front in the East was much longer than in the West. The theater of war was roughly delimited by the Baltic Sea in the West and Moscow in the East, a distance of 1,200 kilometers, and Saint Petersburg in the North and the Black Sea in the South, a distance of more than 1,600 kilometers. This had a drastic effect on the nature of the warfare. While World War I on the Western Front developed into trench warfare, the battle lines on the Eastern Front were much more fluid and trenches never truly developed. This was because the greater length of the front ensured that the density of soldiers in the line was lower so the line was easier to break. Once broken, the sparse communication networks made it difficult for the defender to rush reinforcements to the rupture in the line to mount a rapid counteroffensive and seal off a breakthrough. There was also the fact that the terrain in the Eastern European theater was quite solid, often making it near impossible to construct anything resembling the complicated trench systems on the Western Front, which tended to have muddier and much more workable terrain. In short, on the Eastern front the side defending did not have the overwhelming advantages it had on the Western front. Because of this, front lines in the East kept on shifting throughout the conflict, and not just near the beginning and end of the fighting, as was the case in the West. In fact the greatest advance of the whole war was made in the East by the German Army in the summer of 1915. With the aid of numerous black and white and color photographs, many previously unpublished, the World War I series recreates the battles and campaigns that raged across the surface of the globe, on land, at sea and in the air. The text is complemented by full-color maps that guide the reader through specific actions and campaigns.</p><p>David Jordan is Senior Lecturer at the Joint Services Command and Staff College, Shrivenham, where he teaches Intermediate and Advanced Staff courses.

But when legendary mouse Martin the Warrior comes to her in a dream and explains that the secret to winning back her legs lies within the cursed walls of the ancient abbey Loamhedge, Martha hopes for a hero who will travel to the ruins on her behalf. Enter world-class adventurers Braggon the otter and Sarobando the squirrel. The best friends have come for a visit, and decide to undertake Martha&#x2019;s quest. Yet, just as soon as the two tricksters leave, the peaceful abbey folk fervently wish them back, as Redwall is suddenly under siege from the dread searat Raga Bol and his motley crew of vermin. But even as he endeavors to force the Redwall folk from their cozy nest, Raga Bol is plagued by nightmares of the massive badger archer Lonna Bowstripe, who is coming to end his reign of terror. But will Lonna get to Redwall in time to save the forest folk? And will Martha ever walk again?

Yet it emerged long before paleontologists and geologists worked out the chronology of life on Earth, long before biologists uncovered the molecules that underlie heredity and natural selection. Not until the late twentieth century was the true scope of its power revealed.</p><p>This remarkable new book, featuring more than 150 color illustrations, presents a rich and up-to-date view of evolution that explores the far-reaching implications of Darwin's theory and emphasizes the power, significance, and relevance of evolution to our lives today. After all, we ourselves are the product of evolution, and we can tackle many of our gravest challenges -- from the lethal resurgence of antibiotic-resistant diseases to the wave of extinctions that looms before us -- with a sound understanding of the science. It can help us see our lives in connection to everything that has come before and to every form of life on Earth today.</p><p>Filled with rich narrative, award-winning science writing, and the most up-to-date information on topics ranging from Darwinian medicine and sexual selection to the origins of language, evolutionary psychology, and the controversies surrounding creationism, <em>Evolution</em> tells in riveting detail the story of a remarkable scientific journey, from the emergence to the triumph of an idea.</p></p><p>While its opponents may sneer that "it's just a theory," evolution has transcended that label to take its place as one of the most important ideas in human history. Science journalist Carl Zimmer explores its history and future in <i>Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea</i>, a companion piece to the epic PBS series of the same name. The book, lavishly illustrated with photos of our distant cousins, anatomical diagrams, and timelines, is as beautiful as it is enlightening. While those closely following the field will find little more here than a well-written summation of the state of the art in 2001, readers who have watched the evolutionary debates from a distance will quickly catch up with the details of the principal arguments.<p> Zimmer's text is fresh and expansive, explaining both the minutiae of comparative anatomy and the grand scale of geological time with verve and clarity. Following the trend of turn-of-the-century evolution writers, he treats the religious beliefs of creationists with respect, while firmly insisting that the scientific evidence against their position is too compelling to ignore. Touching on biology, philosophy, theology, politics, and nearly every other field of human thought, <i>Evolution</i> will inspire its readers with the elegance and importance of Darwin's simple theory. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><p>Carl Zimmer is the author of three well-received books on evolution. A Guggenheim fellow in 2002, he writes regularly for magazines, including <em>National Geographic</em>, <em>Science</em>, <em>Newsweek</em>, and <em>Natural History</em>.</p></p><h2>Christmas with Southern Living 2016: The Complete Guide to Holiday Cooking and Decorating</h2><p>For over 30 years, <i>Christmas with Southern Living 2016</i> has delivered holiday inspiration with the turn of every page.

Still, he misses her so much the sadness keeps him awake at night. Lying in the dark, the only thing that helps Ben sleep is to think about elephants, those magnificent creatures that his mother loved too. Sooner or later, the thought of their awesome grace always calms him in a way that his sad father, and his two closest friends, never can. <br> Though Ben feels a particular connection to elephants, just as his mother did, he has only once seen a real one -- at a circus when he was very young. So when word spreads of a small one-ring circus coming to town, Ben anxiously awaits its arrival. His anticipation is more than satisfied when he gets to meet Sala -- whose name means "Sacred Tree" -- the sole survivor of a group of four elephants poisoned by a wicked trainer. With his unusual ability to understand the thoughts of animals, Ben and Sala emerge from the depths of their grief to forge a bond that brings them both comfort and gives Ben renewed hope to face the future. <br> In his first book for young readers, distinguished author Reynolds Price weaves a powerful story that explores the inevitable and essential balance between joy and sorrow and the fine line between the things most exhilarating and frightening in life.</p><p><b>Reynolds Price</b> (1933-2011)&nbsp;was born in Macon, North Carolina.

Author Filippo Voltaggio, who currently hosts the highly regarded &#x201c;The LIFE CHANGES Show,&#x201d; on BBS Radio, and is an internationally known singer, speaker and life coach, offers up his own story...how one little surprise package in fur and four legs transformed his life unexpectedly and put him on a path of self-discovery. Ciccina and the book are both small in size and are unassuming, but they are packed with inspiring lessons, comical moments, and heart-tugging experiences that delight the reader and open up all new possibilities for expansion by the end of the adventure. In The Little Dog That Could, Filippo brings to life the meaning of the adage, &#x201c;When the student is ready, the teacher appears.&#x201d; Two unlikely &#x201c;bedfellows&#x201d; meet by serendipity on a busy street one night, and that meeting transforms both of their lives forever. Through Ciccina, Filippo comes to experience real miracles that transcend time, space and logic. Filippo helps people grasp the power of their sixth sense as he learned it from his little mentor. He shows how we too can expand beyond our traditional perception to a world that is far greater than we perceive on a daily basis. A great gift that unfolds like a classic &#x201c;Hallmark" story, The Little Dog That Could isn&#x2019;t just for dog and animal lovers. It&#x2019;s for anyone who desires to connect to who they truly are and to become more than they ever thought they could be.

Though Filippo has authored many magazine articles, and though writings of his have been featured in books, &#x201c;The Little Dog That Could&#x201d; is his first full-length book. True to the underlying theme of his life, the book is a true story full of life changing experiences between him and a little dog he came to know.

In the predawn light his features were unclear. He was simply a presence of darker blue than the sky behind him. But there was about him a scent of woody smoke and new leaves and the honey of far-off, unseen flowers. The presence pointed at Tendai and said, "You!"</p><p>The boy woke up at once. The first rays of dawn were sliding over the garden wall, and the window was empty. What a strange dream, thought Tendai. He pulled the sheet over his head as he tried to remember it better. The image faded away, leaving a strange sense that something important was about to happen. His ancestors must have felt this way before a big hunt.</p><p>Tendai imagined them lying on the warm earth of their huts, feeling it tremble with destiny. Their shields and spears lay ready by the door. Not like me, he thought. He snuggled into a soft bed in one of the finest mansions in Zimbabwe. Around the house were a large garden and a wall studded with searchlights and alarms. The automatic Doberman growled as it made a last tour of the lawn before retiring to its kennel.</p><p>Any tremble of destiny would have had to struggle through the concrete foundations of the house. It would have had to work through inlaid wooden floors and thick carpets, to creep up the grand staircase to the second floor. Only a whisper could have found its way to his waiting ear.</p><p>Yet find him it did.</p><p>He heard the robot gardeners clipping the grass along a walk. Hoopoes called from jacaranda trees, but a microchip went on with a far better selection of birdsong. It was certainly beautiful, but Tendai felt a pang of regret at not being able to hear the real birds. The mynah &#x2013; a living creature smuggled in by the Mellower &#x2013; stirred in its cage. "Mangwanani," it said. "Have you slept well?"</p><p>Kuda, Tendai's little brother, sat up and answered, "I have done so if you have done so."</p><p>The mynah paid no attention to this polite reply. "Mangawani! Mangawani!" it shrieked, rattling the door of its cage.</p><p>Kuda hopped out of bed and released the bird. It fluttered to a table and snapped up a crust of bread from last night's supper. Tendai could hear the crumbs showering over his books. He pulled the covers more tightly around his ears to keep in the light, happy feeling of excitement.</p><p>A house robor purred as it went from door to door with tea. It entered and placed two steaming cups on the table. The mynah squawked as it was pushed aside. "Good morning," said the robot. "It's September second, 2194. The time is six-fifteen A.M. Breakfast is at seven. Be on time if you know what's good for you."</p><p>"Go away," muttered Kuda as he blew on the hot tea.</p><p>"Anyone who oversleeps is a big fat booboo head," retorted the robot as it glided out.</p><p>"Rita programmed it to say that," Tendai said as he threw back the covers.</p><p>"I know. Well, are you going to ask him?" Kuda swung his short legs off the edge of his chair.</p><p>"I'm not promising anything."</p><p>"You're a wimp."</p><p>Tendai didn't bother to argue. Kuda didn't know how difficult it was to ask Father anything. That duty fell on the eldest brother. Besides, when Kuda got an idea in his head, it took an earthquake to dislodge it. "I had the funniest dream this morning," Tendai began.</p><p>"The mynah just knocked over your tea," Kuda remarked. Tendai grabbed a towel and cleaned up the mess. Then he quickly took a shower and dressed in his Scout uniform. Breakfast was at seven, not a minute earlier or later.</p><p>The two brothers stood outside the dining room door, where they were joined by Rita. She was also in a Scout uniform. A hundred years before, Boy and Girl Scouts had belonged to different organizations, but now they were lumped together. Father approved of them because they taught the virtues most revered by the people of Zimbabwe: loyalty, bravery, courteousness and reverence for Mwari, the supreme god.</p><p>Kuda had no Scout uniform because he was only four. He did his best with a sand-colored shirt and a pair of shorts. "Breakfast!" chimed the door as it swung open. The children trooped in. They lined up in order with Tendai, age thirteen, first and Rita, eleven, second. Tendai was secretly embarrassed that he and Rita were the same height. Kuda was last.</p><p>Mother smiled at them from her chair. She looked cool and elegant in her long white dress. She toyed with a slice of cantaloupe on a blue plate.</p><p>"All present and accounted for," said Father. "Rita, stop slouching." The children stood as tall as they could manage as their father marched from his great chair at the head of the table. He wore a general's uniform with gold braid on his massive shoulders. His chest was covered with medals. Since it was breakfast and he was home and it was a warm day, he left his cap on a hat rack.</p><p>"Shirttail out, Kuda. Five push-ups for you. Rita, pull in your stomach. You are not a watermelon. Tendai-" Father stopped, and Tendai felt sweat prickle on his forehead. He loved his father, but sometimes he wished he wasn't so &#x2013; so military. He suspected Father would like to have Mother at the end of the line, tall and perfectly groomed. But even Father could hardly order her to do push-ups if he detected a loose thread.</p><p>"Tendai passes inspection," said Father, and he stalked back to his chair. Tendai relaxed, not letting it show. Passing inspection was as close as Father ever got to praise. Perhaps he could ask the question after all.</p><p>They were allowed to sit down, but things began to go wrong at once. The maid robot spooned porrideg on the tablecloth. She had to be sent to the kitchen for readjustment. The butler took over the serving. He wouldn't give Rita extra sugar, and she sulked. The holophone trotted up to Father's chair and clamored until he answered it.</p><p>A report began to feed in: pictures of fire engines and ambulances flashed across the screen. Tendai watched idly because he had nothing better to do. The Masks, the only ganag remaining after Father's war on crime, had set off a bomb in a shopping center. Bodies were taken out of the smoking ruins. Statistics rattled across the bottom of the screen. Tendai turned away. It was all remote, of no interest.</p><p>"Accursed Masks!" shouted Father at the holophone. "Get me the police chief!" The phone bobbed and dialed. Father and the police chief made plans while the omelets on everyone's plates got cold.</p><p>Of course no one thought of eating until Father was ready. He was an elder and head of the family.</p><p>"Lizard eggs," muttered Rita, poking at her omelet.</p><p>"Don&#x2019;t start," Tendai said in a low voice.</p><p>"Chickens are descended from reptiles. I read it in a book."</p><p>"Be quiet."</p><p>"Nasty old cold lizard eggs."</p><p>"Is something wrong?" thundered Father from the head of the table.</p><p>"No," said Tendai, Rita and Kuda all together.</p><p>"Everything's delicious," added Rita. "Especially the eggs."</p><p>"Is it too much to ask," shouted Father, "when I'm trying to protect ten million citizens from packs of hyenas that want to tear down our civilization, <i>is it too much to ask for a little peace and quiet at the breakfast table</i>&gt;" He slammed the receiver down. The holophone whimpered and cowered against a wall.</p><p>Everyone ate in silence. Tendai had a mental picture of his father lining up everyone in the city. "Ten push-ups for you, twenty for you," he would growl as he inspected a line of ten million people. Tendai had to clench his jaws to keep from laughing.</p><p>"What's this?" said Father as the butler robot placed a rack of dry toast by his plate.</p><p>"No butter until your blood pressure goes down. Doctor's orders," the butler said.</p><p>"I hate dry toast." But Father piled it with blackberry jam and ate it anyway.</p><p>Tendai listened to the birdsong in the garden. He couldn't ask about the Scout trip now. They were going to spend another long, boring day locked up in the house. All because Father was afraid they would get kidnapped.</p><p>"It's time for the Mellower," said Mother in her gentle voice. Everyone looked up, even Father, although he pretended he was only checking the time. The butler robot cleared away the dishes. They sat expectantly, watching the door.</p><p>"He's late," said Mother.</p><p>"He's always late," said Father.</p><p>Tendai felt a disloyal twinge of pleasure. The Mellower was the one person Father couldn't organize. The Mellower had smudges on his shoes. Buttons dropped off his shirt and were forgotten. His lunches lasted three hours, and he made paper airplanes of the homework he was supposed to supervise. Tendai, Rita and Kuda often covered up for him.</p><p>"I'll send the butler after him," sighed Mother.</p><p>"If he were one of my soldiers, I'd order him to do fifty push-ups," Father said. "No, a hundred."</p><p>The sprinklers in the garden switched on; the odor of wet dust drifted through the window. It made Tendai think of the storms that blew out of the Indian Ocean. He thought of the faces of his ancestors turned toward the sky. They smiled as the rain opened the earth. They sang praises to Mwari, whose voice is thunder, and to mhondoro, the spirit of the land&#x2014;</p><p>"Wake up," whispered Rita, kicking him under the table. Tendai straightened just as Father looked at his end of the table.</p><p>"It <i>can't</i> be seven-thirty," came the Mellower's voice from down the hall. "I'm sure I set the alarm. Oh, dear, I'm such a bad boy." He hurried through the door and brushed a mop of blond hair from his pale forehead.</p><p>"What wonderful, patient people...</p></p><h2>The Politics of the Veil (The Public Square)</h2><p><p>In 2004, the French government instituted a ban on the wearing of "conspicuous signs" of religious affiliation in public schools. Though the ban applies to everyone, it is aimed at Muslim girls wearing headscarves. Proponents of the law insist it upholds France's values of secular liberalism and regard the headscarf as symbolic of Islam's resistance to modernity. <i>The Politics of the Veil</i> is an explosive refutation of this view, one that bears important implications for us all.</p><br><p> Joan Wallach Scott, the renowned pioneer of gender studies, argues that the law is symptomatic of France's failure to integrate its former colonial subjects as full citizens. She examines the long history of racism behind the law as well as the ideological barriers thrown up against Muslim assimilation. She emphasizes the conflicting approaches to sexuality that lie at the heart of the debate--how French supporters of the ban view sexual openness as the standard for normalcy, emancipation, and individuality, and the sexual modesty implicit in the headscarf as proof that Muslims can never become fully French. Scott maintains that the law, far from reconciling religious and ethnic differences, only exacerbates them. She shows how the insistence on homogeneity is no longer feasible for France--or the West in general--and how it creates the very "clash of civilizations" said to be at the root of these tensions.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Politics of the Veil</i> calls for a new vision of community where common ground is found amid our differences, and where the embracing of diversity--not its suppression--is recognized as the best path to social harmony.</p></p><p><br><p>"Brilliant, crisp, and cogently argued. Joan W. Scott's novel and trenchant discursive analysis exposes the prejudices of the reductionist French versions of secularism and feminism regarding Islam and French Muslims from North African and Arab origins. The study is illuminating far beyond the French case, as former colonial and/or working subjects struggle for integration and recognition of their difference."<b>--Abdellah Hammoudi, Princeton University</b><br></p><br><p>"Carefully argued, insightful and humane, Joan Scott's <i>The Politics of the Veil</i> is far and away the best account of France's identity crisis that was signaled by the famous headscarf affair. The final chapter, on the symbolic meanings of the headscarf/veil, is the most original and brilliant piece of writing that I have read on this topic. This is an indispensable book, transcending the particularity of French obsessions and forcing the reader to think about wider political problems that concern us all."<b>--Talal Asad, author of <i>On Suicide Bombing</i><br></b><br></p><br><p>"Scott traces the history and politics of veil controversies in France and draws apart intertwined strands, starting with the legacy of racism from the colonial past. She persuasively argues for the negotiation of cultural and religious differences rather than their negation. This book will be required reading for all those concerned with the integration of Muslims into Western Christian societies."<b>--Beth Baron, author of<i>Egypt as a Woman: Nationalism, Gender, and Politics</i><br></b><br></p><br><p>"This is an important and timely book that will challenge the dominant terms used to debate the French government's ban on the veil in public schools. Through a careful analysis of historical and contemporary French discourse on Muslims and Arabs, Scott helps us see how the controversy over the veil is indexical of a deep paradox that haunts the ideology of French Republicanism of which the principle of la�cit� is a crucial part."<b>--Saba Mahmood, author of<i>Politics of Piety: The Islamic Revival and the Feminist Subject</i><br></b><br></p><br><b>Joan Wallach Scott</b> is the Harold F.

Biting my lip, I pressed harder still, desperate to stop the bleeding. &#x201c;Hold him, boys.&#x201d;</p><p>The apprentices gathered around the table grabbed tight to his arms and legs, all of them wide-eyed and pale as they tried to keep him from moving. The wooden table beneath my aged patient creaked and complained at the added weight as the room echoed with the sound of our leather shoes slapping against the stone floor and my patient&#x2019;s frantic panting.</p><p>A quick glance around the large kitchen told me that there were no other healers in sight. They were all in the main hall, tending the others. Just the apprentices, clustered around the table. Blood bubbled up between my fingers, warm and thick. The metallic smell was strong and settled in my mouth. There was something wrong with the smell, but I was too busy to think on it. One of the lads frantically waved a fresh bandage before my eyes, and I snatched it, crammed it into the wound, and pressed down. I had to get it stopped. The bandage turned to scarlet before my eyes.</p><p>The man under my hands groaned and thrashed, trying to get away from the pain. One of the smaller lads was flung away. The patient&#x2019;s freed arm swiped through the air, catching me on the cheek. Vision blurred for a precious instant as my head rocked back with the blow. My hair came loose, and one long brown curl floated down to lie in the blood that surrounded my hands. The felled boy scrambled up and threw himself back into the fray, grabbing the flailing arm and wrestling it down. &#x201c;Sorry, Lara,&#x201d; he told me.</p><p>&#x201c;Hold him.&#x201d; My voice was a croak. I was too harsh on the lads who were trying their best. Their bloodless faces were pale blurs. I heard the one next to me swallowing rapidly. Pray to the Goddess that he&#x2019;d not spew on the wound. My shoulders tightened as I tried to increase the pressure, trying to staunch the red flow. &#x201c;I need help here.&#x201d; I raised my voice to carry into the main hall that was filled with wounded and other healers.</p><p>&#x201c;Lara? What&#x2019;s happened?&#x201d; A quiet, calm voice came from behind me.</p><p>It was Eln, thank the Goddess.</p><p>The warrior surged up again, and the table squeaked in protest. We stayed with him, trying to keep him still, trying to keep the pressure on. He cried out suddenly, then sagged back, exhausted. I gulped in breath to answer. &#x201c;The shard came out clean but he&#x2019;s bleeding.&#x201d;</p><p>A head popped in next to mine as Eln craned his scrawny neck to have a look. My teacher for years, he always moved like a gray lake-crane. He made a noncommittal noise, then pulled a deep breath in through his nose. I gritted my teeth. Sometimes he decides that I need a lesson in the midst of saving a life, even though I&#x2019;ve held my mastery for years. Eln&#x2019;s head pulled back, but I could feel him standing behind me.</p><p>&#x201c;Not my patient, and not my place to say.&#x201d; Eln&#x2019;s voice was quiet, but cut through the moans of the warrior. &#x201c;But what happens after you stop the bleeding?&#x201d;</p><p>I slammed my eyes shut. My patient shifted again, and we moved with him, automatically.</p><p>&#x201c;Stubborn child . . .&#x201d; Eln&#x2019;s voice was a whisper, but I heard it. &#x201c;You may have gained your mastery but you haven&#x2019;t truly learned, have you?&#x201d;</p><p>I did not want to concede to his wisdom, did not want to face what the scent of waste in the blood meant, the scent I&#x2019;d failed to identify a moment before. But experience had been a hard teacher, harder than Eln had ever been. With a nod, and a strangled sob, I released the pressure on the wound. The apprentices froze, not understanding.</p><p>&#x201c;Come, boys.&#x201d; Eln spoke quietly. &#x201c;Come with me.&#x201d;</p><p>I ignored them all as they filed out. One stopped, and looked at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;d ya stop?&#x201d;</p><p>Kneeling to wash my hands in a bucket on the floor, I looked up into his wide young eyes. &#x201c;Eln will tell you, child. Go now.&#x201d;</p><p>Eln would not miss a chance to give a lesson, a chance to explain the slow, painful death of a belly wound that stank of waste. Explain that a good healer knew when to let a patient go, that death wasn&#x2019;t always an enemy. Explain that good healers didn&#x2019;t stubbornly refuse to acknowledge their limits. I wished them the best of it, for it was a lesson I&#x2019;d never learned.</p><p>Coward that I was, I took a moment to rinse my tunic and trous of the worst of the blood. That might save me some abuse from Anna when I returned to the castle. She claimed that I didn&#x2019;t own a piece of clothing that didn&#x2019;t have blood on it at one time or another. The cool, wet cloth felt good against my hot and sweaty skin.</p><p>I took a fresh bowl of water and a clean cloth and bathed the man&#x2019;s face. The bleeding had turned sluggish. It would not be long now. The man sighed and relaxed, muscles releasing their tension under my touch.</p><p>Aye, Eln would offer a lesson. But I would offer comfort to a dying man.</p><p>The water seemed to ease him, and I put the cloth down for a moment, and steadied myself. I forced myself to rinse my hands again, working the nails to get the blood off. I took a moment to clean the one stray lock of hair and tuck it up again. My hair was a constant irritation, the curls were never content to stay neat on top of my head.</p><p>The kitchen had cleared again. It was the best room in the old barracks to use for the worst of the wounded. The large tables served well, and every counter and cupboard was filled with jars and bowls of ointments and remedies. I stared at their bright colors and the false promise of the claims that they could cure all ails. But nothing lay there that could save this man.</p><p>A noise drew my attention down. His eyes fluttered open. Once again I took up the water and cloth. As I worked, he focused on me, a question in his stare. I smiled.</p><p>&#x201c;You are in the healing house, warrior. You took a wound. Rest now.&#x201d;</p><p>He licked his lips, narrowed his eyes. &#x201c;Lance . . . tip broke off . . . belly.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. No need to speak. He knew.</p><p>He closed his eyes, then opened them again and for the first time he seemed to really look at me. &#x201c;Fought with your father, Lady.&#x201d; He gasped as the effort cost him breath. His voice was soft and tight.</p><p>I paused. Few were left that could claim to have known my father. &#x201c;I am sorry, but I don&#x2019;t know you.&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t seem to hear me. One corner of his mouth turned up. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve his eyes, child. All fey blue and wise.&#x201d; His arm trembled as he tried to raise his hand. I caught it and held it in mine. His eyes got a strange light in them, perhaps an echo of his younger self. &#x201c;Now there was a king, your father. What a warrior he was.&#x201d; He looked over my shoulder, seeing into the mists of memory.</p><p>&#x201c;I miss him,&#x201d; I said quietly.</p><p>A wave of pain crossed his face. &#x201c;Aye, Lady,&#x201d; was the breathless response. &#x201c;So do we all.&#x201d; He seemed to gather strength somehow, and he squeezed my hand and gave a slight tug. I lowered my hand to his mouth. With a rasping breath, he spoke. &#x201c;My hand to yours. Bless you, Xylara, Daughter of the House of Xy, Daughter of Xyron, Warrior King.&#x201d; He pressed his dry lips to the back of my hand.</p><p>It had been long since I&#x2019;d heard those old words. I kissed his forehead. &#x201c;My hand to yours. Blessings upon you, Warrior of the House of Xy.&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled, slipping into death even as his hand slipped from mine.</p><p><b>&#x201c;YOU CARE TOO MUCH.&#x201d; IT WAS ELN AGAIN.</b></p><p>His voice floated over the stone tubs that had been set aside to wash instruments. I ignored him for the moment, concentrating on getting things clean and ready for the next wave of wounded. Experience taught that the lulls in the fighting were to be used, not wasted.</p><p>&#x201c;A good healer is dispassionate. Objective.&#x201d;</p><p>The warrior&#x2019;s body had been taken up for burial. He had been the last of the severely wounded. I had a small cluster of unhappy apprentices outside, boiling bandages and linens. Not their favorite chore, but a vital one.</p><p>Eln had started brewing more orchid root at the fire. The sweet scent was a comfort. Others were tending the large kettles of fever&#x2019;s foe outside. Everyone, no matter how tired, worked and waited. For the sounds of more battle, more wounded. I closed my eyes, giving in to my exhaustion, and prayed for an end to the war that waged outside the city walls. Prayed that the Firelanders would stop using their lances. Prayed that I&#x2019;d be skilled enough that no more of my patients would die.</p><p>Eln rattled the jars and bottles, and I opened my eyes and watched him. My old teacher, his long arms stretching out, putting them in some kind of order. Slow and steady, moving carefully on tall legs, considering each step. The straight, gray hair that flowed down his back only added to the image of a lake-crane. He gave me a look out of the corner of his eye, and shook his head. &#x201c;How can one so slight be so stubborn?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Eln, how long was I your apprentice?&#x201d;</p><p>He stared pointedly at my bruised cheek. &#x201c;Long enough to learn.&#x201d; He regarded me with a solemn look.</p><p>&#x201c;And I have been a master for how long?&#x201d; I rinsed more of the instruments and set them on a cloth to dry.</p><p>He pursed his lips, and pretended to study one of the jars. &#x201c;Long enough to learn to talk back.&#x201d;</p><p>I snorted. &#x201c;During that period, how many times have you said that to me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;More than I can count, but that does not make it any less true.&#x201d; He started to gather up the things we would need to check the wounded and tend them. &#x201c;If you are so wise, Lara, then why do I see guilt in your eyes?&#x201d;</p><p>I glanced out the kitchen window. The afternoon shadows were growing. &#x201c;I should not have tried to cut it out. Should have left it alone. If I had . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If.&#x201d; Eln came to stand next to me. &#x201c;If you had left it in, was his death not as sure? You tried. That was all you could do. All any of us can do when we are overwhelmed like this.&#x201d;</p><p>I dried my hands, and blinked back tears I didn&#x2019;t have time for. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d better get to work.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Spiritual Odyssey of Freda Bedi: England, India, Burma, Sikkim, and Beyond</h2><p><p>Freda Bedi had a big heart and a big life.

In such stories as <i>Deadfall</i> and the Anthony Award-winning <i>Murder on the Iditarod Trail</i>, Henry follows in the sled and snowshoe tracks of writers like Jack London and Robert W. Service, who realized that Alaska was the last great frontier of adventure. Her characters, like champion sled-dog racer Jessie Arnold, are welcome throwbacks to a simpler period when physical challenge was a healthy way to measure self-esteem. <p> Jessie is testing herself in the thousand-mile Yukon Quest race, which follows the old mail trail from Whitehorse to Fairbanks, when one of the other racers is kidnapped and held for ransom. The kidnappers insist that only Jessie can deliver the money, and it has to be on the most dangerous leg of the race. Any attempt to involve the police will result in the victim's death. Of course, the worst blizzard of the year blows up just as the race gets to that point, and it goes without saying that Jessie risks herself and her beloved dog team to recover the victim and capture the bad guys. Even if the thought of somebody shouting "Mush!" fills you with silent laughter, you're sure to be gripped by Henry's ability to recreate the pleasures and perils of an arcane sport in a breathtaking landscape. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p><p>Sue Henry is the author of six novels in her award-winning Alaska mystery series: <i>Murder on the Iditarod Trail, Termination Dust, Sleeping Lady, Death Takes Passage, Deadfall, </i>and <i>Murder on the Yukon Quest.</i> She has lived in Alaska for almost a quarter of a century, and brings history, Alaskan lore, and the majestic beauty of the vast landscape to her mysteries.

The editor of the literary magazine Black Clock, he also writes about film for Los Angeles and teaches at CalArts.With the surreal effects of William Burroughs, Erickson spells out a nightmarish vision of the seedy underbelly of the Twentieth Centurya phrase that's portentously capitalized throughout this wildly uneven phantasmagoria. Its anti-hero, Banning Jainlight, raised on a Pennsylvania ranch, has sex with an Indian housemaid who turns out to be his real mother; so he throws his father out of a window and escapes to sleazy New York where he churns out porn novels. His Austrian mentor bids him to Vienna, where he ends up as Hitler's secret pornographer, writing tawdry scenes to slake the Fuhrer's obsession with a real-life niece. Jainlight's first-person spiela torrent of drunken poetry, erotic longing and cynicismis intertwined with the stories of Dania, a Russian dancer living with her half-mad father inside a revolving crater in Sudan, and of Zeno, an old ferryman who shuttles tourists to an anonymous Chinatown. Suddenly it's 1967 and our shy pornographer is holed up with Hitler in a dank Italian prison, plotting escape. Erickson ( Rubicon Beach ) overextends himself here, but before this powerful, haunting fantasy falls apart it insinuates itself into the reader's mind through its reckless confrontation with evil. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hermann Hesse: Life and art</h2><p>"A critical biography far surpassing the previous ones."--<i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>&nbsp;"There are to be sure many writers whose biographies are more interesting than their fiction but Hesse is not one of these. He led a long and sometimes eventful life with marital tensions, traveL controversy, crises, even some thoughts of suicide and a period of time as a student in a home for retarded and unmanageable. In addition, there was his search which led him through the culture and arts of West and East, his views of politics and society, of psychology and philosophy. The difference between Hesse and other writers is that virtually every shred and patch of his life was brought into his writing, his fiction particularly. 'He had to write about himself and there is little of what he wrote that is not confessional in form and therapeutic in function.' Autobiography is the very matter of his work. Mileck's contribution is to extend and fill out the evidence of his life, his psychoanalysis, his drive toward self-realization which was the very engine of his being, to show the raw material and thus to invite readers to see how it was transmuted, transfigured, fantasized, poeticized, symbolized."--<i>Los Angeles Times</i>&nbsp;"Hesse was a prolific author for some 60 years, and his mind drew everything it contemplated into his private wars between flesh and spirit. objectivity and subjectivity, the longings for society and isolation. No one is better qualified to disentangle this abundance than Mileck, compiler of the huge two-volume Hesse bibliography. For completeness, then, no biography in English compares."&nbsp;--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>&nbsp;"Mileck provides his own translations of the German quotations from Hesse's works, and the eight interpretive chapters are thoroughly indexed, making the work readily accessible to researchers and students concerned with specific Hesse questions and themes. This very readable book also contains a number of exceptional photographs, which, together with Mileck's fervor and understanding of the author, help create a living image of Hesse the man and the artist."--<i>Choice</i>&nbsp;"Professor Mileck . .. brings to his task an acquaintanceship with Hesse's published and unpublished writings .. . which borders on omniscience. This is a literary biography which concentrates on the works and looks at the life of its subject briefly and always in relation to its involvement with the works . . . [This] is true scholarship, which does not make the book less readable and accessible to the general public. . . . a solid and valuable book which should make it easier . . . to bring [Hesse] back into the orbit of serious appreciation in the English-speaking world."&nbsp;--<i>Books and Bookmen</i></p><p><b>Joseph Mileck</b> is Professor Emeritus, Department of German, University of California Berkeley</p><h2>Discovering Stained Glass in Detroit</h2><p><p>The Detroit area boasts many fine examples of stained glass representing a variety of periods and styles.

This volume takes a fresh look at the renowned artist whose simultaneous innovations in painting, drawing, ceramics, and sculpture, as well as his spatial explorations, pushed the painterly into the sculptural and redefined the relationship between&nbsp;the arts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Evaluating Fontana&#x2019;s&nbsp;interest in synthesis and moving beyond his famous slashed canvases, this book reveals Fontana to be one of the first installation artists. Essays by international experts address his work from both an Italian and Argentine perspective, providing numerous insights into Fontana&#x2019;s expansive practice. Archival images of environments, public commissions, installations, and now-destroyed pieces accompany lavish illustrations covering his production from 1930 to the late 1960s, establishing&nbsp;a new&nbsp;approach to an artist who&nbsp;responded to the political, cultural, and technological thresholds that defined the mid-20th century.</p><p>This beautiful book offers a historic reassessment of the work of one of the most innovative artists of the 20th century, emphasizing his interdisciplinary approach to both art and life.<b>Iria Candela</b> is Estrellita B.

Ms. Downer is also a frequent contributor to <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>.The first Japanese actress of modern times, Sadayakko (1871-1946) shared the stage with Isadora Duncan and influenced Puccini's writing of Madame Butterfly. Unfortunately, this biography, a follow-up to Downer's Women of the Pleasure Quarters, never takes wing despite the author's best efforts to track down relatives who still remember the actress, sold by her family to become a geisha at age five. Pieced together from newspaper clippings and writings by contemporaries, the book fails to capture the excitement of Sadayakko's success. Like many geisha, who were considered social outcasts, Sadayakko married into the theater at age 19 by choosing a husband, Otojiro, from among the "riverbed beggars," as actors were then known. She joined him on stage during his troupe's first American tour, but soon she became a bigger star than he. Otojiro founded New Wave drama, or shimpa, which was much less stylized than traditional kabuki, yet Downer makes a strong case that Sadayakko was every bit as important as Otojiro to the development of Japanese theater. But Sadayakko, who was eager to support her husband, left no record to indicate the exact nature of her role, if any, in the development of his plays. After Otojiro's death, Sadayakko continued to act and to train other young actresses. Although Sadayakko was a captivating character, Downer doesn't come up with enough facts to present an equally captivating story.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Elevator Music: A Surreal History of Muzak, Easy-Listening, and Other Moodsong</h2><p>Presents a cultural history of mood music and explores its psychological, social, and commercial aspects</p><p>Joseph Lanza is currently writing an impressionistic history of romantic pop ballads. He has served as an independent consultant for Time Life Music and was executive producer for the two-disc collection Music for TV Dinners (Caroline Records). His most recent book is about the legendary crooner Russ Columbo.Philosophy and history of American background music by pop- culture historian Lanza (Fragile Geometry, 1991--not reviewed). Lanza focuses on a variety of different types of what he calls ``moodsong,'' from commercial Muzak through the sugary strings of Mantovani and the purling choruses of Ray Coniff on to '80s ``new age'' sounds. He is unabashed in his admiration for all of these styles, asserting that they are ``in many respects, aesthetically superior to all other musical forms.'' He traces the history of so- called ``functional music'' to the work of avant-garde artists of the early 20th century such as Erik Satie, who sought to wed art with the innovations of the machine age, and early heroes include Muzak's inventor/originator, General George Owen Squier, who studied the effect of music on productivity and mood. Lanza is most interesting in analyzing the psychology of Muzak programming, showing how the company developed a schedule based on the time of day, so that, for example, ``the breakfast hours offered cheery sunrise melodies and caffeinated rhythms.'' The book's midsection is a listener's guide to the golden age of easy listening, with descriptions of cocktail-conductor Jackie Gleason, the bubbly champagne music of Lawrence Welk, and the swooning voices of the Anita Kerr singers. In closing, Lanza addresses philosophical issues in Muzak; the possible evil effects of background music; the phenomena of '70s ``lite'' music and ``metarock''; and the adaptation of rock songs to the Muzak aesthetic. Still, however mightily he may argue that ``elevator music...is essentially a distillation of the happiness that modern technology has promised,'' Lanza fails to convince that the ``easy listening'' creators were really more than schlockmeisters with a commercial bent.

In 1911, a Yale professor in search of a lost Inca city was led to the site of Machu Picchu by local Indians. In this lavishly illustrated picture book, Lewin traces Professor Bingham's steps through the tangled mountain jungle to his exciting discovery. The language is graceful and uncomplicated, weaving in bits of background history along the way, and Lewin builds suspense at just the right pace: "They came to a grand stone staircase. Where could this lead? What else was here?" But it's the artwork that will really attract attention. Full-page watercolor spreads of the stunning vistas and thick forests contrast with dark, intimate views of Bingham inside homes and walking along walled city streets, searching for leads. A map of Peru and suggested further reading lists would have been welcome additions, but Lewin includes comprehensive notes that explain the excavation of Machu Picchu, as well as the primary sources he consulted. An exciting, eye-catching story for early elementary social studies units. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Anderson, a young Swedish-born settler near Fort Niobrara, Nebraska, bought a camera with earnings from carpentry work. He soon became a full-fledged photographer, and in 1889 General George Crook asked him to serve as official photographer to the Crook Treaty Commission on its visit to the Brul� Sioux Indians on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota. Anderson agreed&#x2014;and thereby moved into a poignant and oftentimes tragic era in the history of the Sioux. From 1891 until his death in 1948, Anderson lived on the Rosebud, recording the painful adjustment of the proud Brul�s to life on the reservation.<br><br>This was a particularly hard time for the Brul�s. Nomadic warriors by nature, they had been subjugated following their greatest triumph at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 and were living like captives on what had once been their buffalo hunting grounds. The buffaloes were dead, and the Indians had been forced to accept white men&#x2019;s ways and white men&#x2019;s provender. To help feed themselves, they were compelled to farm&#x2014;to &#x201c;scratch the ground,&#x201d; as they scornfully expressed it&#x2014;a way of life they regarded as shameful.<br><br>Anderson became a sincere friend of the Indian, who learned to trust him and allowed him to record their daily lives and their ceremonies. Anderson photographed Sioux camps, villages, and day schools; recorded councils between whites and Indians; and portrayed the Indians as they received their beef rations and annuity payments. When Buffalo Bill Cody and Charles P. Jordan organized their wild-west shows, he photographed the Sioux who joined the shows. Anderson was afforded the rare privilege of attending and photographing the White Buffalo, Sun dance, and Omaha Dance ceremonies. Anderson gave many of the photographs to his Sioux friends, who proudly displayed them in their cabins on the Rosebud.<br><br>Over the years many other photographs found their way into museums and state historical societies. Henry W. Hamilton and his wife, Jean Tyree Hamilton, first became aware of Anderson and his work through the papers of Remington Schuyler, the well-known artist and writer, who also lived on the Rosebud. The Hamiltons searched out prints and glass-plate negatives and, with the help of Indian consultants on the reservation, painstakingly dated the photographs and identified the subjects.<br><br>The wealth of photographs Anderson took is represented here by more than 200 reproductions&#x2014;the largest number ever published in a single collection. They are presented not as works of art (though many of them are indeed triumphs of the photographic art) but as important historical documents in the ongoing story of the American Indian.<br></p><p><b>Henry W.

It was a wonderful book, elegant, incisive, and humane, it dealt fairly with politics and legislation, but above all it revealed the dynamic appeal of early Protestant ideas to academics and artisans, preachers and parishioners. It was by far the best survey of its subject, and it has not been overtaken since. . . . This second edition is a response to recent &#x2018;revisionist&#x2019; suggestions&#x2014;that the old Church had vitality and appeal, that its rituals and beliefs were supportive and supported, that Protestants had a hard time making converts, and that political machinations, not protest movements, were the agent of change. . . .

It was the most harrowing and holy experience of her life.<br><br>Following a 414-day relapse into alcohol and drug addiction after more than a decade clean and sober, Schwartz was sentenced and served her time with only six months' sobriety. The damage she inflicted that year upon her friends, her husband, her teenage daughter, and herself was nearly impossible to fathom. Incarceration might have ruined her altogether, if not for the stories that sustained her while she was behind bars--both the artful tales in the books she read while there, and, more immediately, the stories of her fellow inmates. With classics like Edith Wharton's <i>Ethan Frome </i>to contemporary accounts like Laura Hillenbrand's <i>Unbroken</i>, Schwartz's reading list is woven together with visceral recollections of both her daily humiliations and small triumphs within the county jail system. Through the stories of others--whether rendered on the page or whispered in a jail cell--she learned powerful lessons about how to banish shame, use guilt for good, level her grief, and find the lost joy and magic of her astonishing life. <br><br>Told in vivid, unforgettable prose, <i>The Lost Chapters</i> uncovers the nature of shame, rage, and love, and how instruments of change and redemption come from the unlikeliest of places.</p><p>Leslie Schwartz is the author of two literary novels, <i>Jumping the Green</i>, winner of the <i>James Jones Literary Society Awardfor Best First Novel</i> and <i>Angels Crest</i>.

We are nude while deputies with guns order us to squat and cough while they shine flashlights up our asses and vaginas. The woman next to me, probably in her forties, is on her period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm bleeding," she says. She is crying softly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Shut up and squat," her deputy says.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I watch her menstrual blood flow to the floor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A rabbi who I spoke to for comfort in the days leading up to my surrender to Century Regional Detention Facility said, "They can take your clothes, but they can't take your dignity."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was wrong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I know this now as I comply with orders in this barnlike structure. It is intolerably cold and dark and cavernous. I am not afraid. I am outraged.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After they shine their flashlight up me, hands on their guns, then order me to give up my clothes and put their plastic underwear and size triple-X blues on, the God I think I know is incinerated. A rogue hatred settles into my spirit and makes a rat's nest of that small part of me where I store such things. Even in the years to come, I cannot release the memory of such indignity, the exposure of my most private body, under threat of gun and billy club, to people who collect a paycheck for probing me there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a reason people use the cattle metaphor when speaking about jails. When I am dressed in my blues and shoes two sizes too large for me, I am marched back with the others, again, into the holding cell. Except when in the strip-search area, I have been in this holding cell for nearly two days, stuffed full of women sitting on the urine-soaked floor. The cell is packed. There must be a hundred of us shoved into a space the size of a garden shed. The other three "holding" cells are also exploding with bodies, so many that the barred doors-throwback to an earlier time before steel firewalled doors-cannot be locked. I still have not eaten. I have not had a drink. I don't know what time it is. The clock on the wall is stuck at 2:37.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hours pass by, each minute an entire anthem to human depravity. At one point, a young woman scowls at a huge, butchy guard. The guard tells her, "Wipe that off your face." The young woman says, "Fuck you." It happens so fast-she is dragged from the holding cell and handcuffed. She kicks out, flailing, and is tased and hauled away. I have seen people discard trash with more sensitivity. In that moment, the memory of my last arrest, the violence of it, comes to the surface. I am momentarily unable to breathe as I shove it down and away, to be dealt with later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While in holding, one woman braids my hair for me. She is very thin and frail. Another offers to trade shoes. Hers are too small for her, but they fit me perfectly. A third offers me a spot on the bench, moving over to make room for my tiny body. In jail, where overcrowding is the norm, it pays to be small. When lukewarm milk and plastic-wrapped meat-product burritos arrive, my stomach turns. I give mine to the prostitute next to me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am almost six months clean and sober and I spend the time in holding staring in amazement at the junkies and prostitutes, thinking about how I got here. It is not easy, because due to the blackout all I remember of it is the beating I took at the hands of LAPD-a relentless memory that invades my thinking with a stubborn regularity, like a drumbeat that never stops. For 414 days until, miraculously, I stopped drinking and using, I lived in a state of chronic blackout. According to neuroscientists, the alcohol- and drug-induced blackout is not simply a case of memory loss. People who suffer from blackouts never retrieve their memories because there are no memories to retrieve. The mind-altering substances in high doses interfere with the way the brain processes and makes memories. In a blackout, because of the drugs and/or alcohol, no memories are ever recorded by the brain. It is as if your life never happened.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This would not be true for the people I most damaged by my drinking and using. They remembered everything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As I sit there, waiting, waiting, waiting to be processed, I try to hold onto the thought that at least I am sober. I am sober as they pull me out of the cell to take my mug shot. It will be my fourth one and, I know, my last. I understood then, after having my photo taken by police over and over again, why in some cultures it is believed that photographs steal your soul. After that, they fit my wrist with a band. It looks like an industrial-grade hospital band, but it is secured with unbreakable grommets. The deputy puts it on too tight. I am skin and bones, and it rubs my wrist, already torn and scarred by handcuffs, raw and bloody. The wristband contains my name and booking number and a barcode. I don't know what the barcode is for until one day in my last module one of the deputies scans it with a handheld device and every piece of information you could ever want about me-age, criminal charges, release dates, etc.-pops up on his small portable screen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To know that my identity has been reduced to a wristband pains me. I struggle against losing my freedom, against having these twenty-two-year-old deputies lord over me, as if I am nothing. They send me back to holding and now there are even more of us. It must be Saturday night, though who could tell? Time itself no longer exists. Only thoughts of time are alive. The time I am wasting is the most painful rumination; it haunts me. The time I am away from my husband and daughter is an unbearable notion. The time I am not writing or gardening. All these thoughts, yet I cannot gain a perspective of time. As Augustine of Hippo said, some sixteen hundred years ago about time, "If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I just know it must be later now, the animal hours of a Saturday night. The women seem drunker. Some are clearly tweaking. More prostitutes have arrived. It is a sea of black and brown faces. The white women are few and far between, maybe one or two who look like me. Housewives, college graduates, people who live near fancy coffee shops and wear Lululemon. When we catch each other's eyes, we turn away, as if we know each other and are embarrassed to be caught seen in this place. Some of the women sleep sitting up. I can't. I am pretty sure I won't sleep for the next six weeks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A few hours later, I am told to line up-for what, I don't know. After about half an hour of standing there, I am ushered into a room where they take my X-ray. They are looking for TB. It is clear the technician hates being there. He just wants to go home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hurry up," he says to each and every one of us when he is done. "I don't have all day."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After about another hour-maybe five, though without clocks, it is difficult to tell-they finally call me. I am not a name anymore, but a number: 4261531. I am moving out of processing and into medical, the next step on the way to permanent housing. I line up with about twenty other women. Jail is confinement, but when it's not confinement, it's lining up along red stripes on the ground and then walking along the green line to the next place. They march us to a large bin where inmates in jail clothes different from the rest of us hand us our bedding. I learn these inmates are trustees who "work" in the modules. Our bedding consists of a thin, torn blanket. Rolled up inside I am supposed to find a sheet, a nightgown, thermals, and men's tube socks. I don't. There are no pillows and no pillowcases. No one gets those.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Holding my roll-up, I wait in line. Again. For god knows how long. Time has changed since I've been in here. It has slowed so far down it feels as if it's stopped. What is my daughter doing now? My husband? My best friend, Anadel? Is anyone walking the dog? Is it daylight? Or is it dark? Einstein's famous line comes to mind: "The distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion." This has never been truer. The now that I live in isn't anything like the now that my beloveds occupy. Theirs is different space. Time, as Einstein showed us, is relative. If my family and friends are locked into my experience by their empathy, the now they experience is swifter, kinder, freer. And what they experience of time, they do so wearing their own underwear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Y</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally after another hour of standing, roll-up in arms, we are marched to medical. I do not know yet that in the thirty-seven days I will spend here out of my ninety-day sentence, once I am in "permanent housing" I will actually be moved five times. Movement is essential for control. It disrupts. It causes anxiety and fear. It limits the chances for friendships and alliances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As I stand in medical, waiting to process to my first locked cell, I remember one piece of advice a nun I had spoken to gave me. She was the former chaplain at Lynwood, and someone I knew gave me her number.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Take the bottom bunk if you can. The jail is colder than a meat locker. The top bunk is coldest."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The icy refrigerator that is jail has lodged into the sinews of my 104-pound body. When I am assigned a cell, I make a fast walk of it for the bottom bunk, heeding the nun's advice. The bunkie I will share this five-by-ten locked concrete cell with is right behind me. I can feel her breath. She, too, is racing for the bottom bunk. I get there first and claim the lower, warmer metal plank of the bed. But immediately I feel terrible that I have won this small victory because it comes at a cost to her. I lie there, guilty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My bunkie is a beautiful twenty-year-old heroin addict who is kicking. Almost immediately she is shitting and throwing up. I am not upset by this. I have been there. I understand. I blame my addiction partly on my empathy, because empathy hurts. I always viewed my tenderness with unfriendliness. All my life, even as a kid, especially as a kid, I'd felt broken by a sixth sense that the world was hard, that people and animals suffered needlessly, that base human nature tended toward cruelty. My empathy seemed innate, as true to me as the color of my eyes. It was a total liability in life. Until I started really drinking and using drugs, I wasn't capable of the toughness it seemed you needed to stay alive, to compete and win, win, win. My skin felt perennially inside out. But once I could hide out behind substances, I found merciful release. Only then was it easier not to care about other people, to play games and get along. But strangely, in jail I will learn that empathy is my greatest asset.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Melissa and I are exactly the same height and weight and coincidentally live in the same neighborhood "on the outs." She is second-generation Cuban, thirty-three years younger than me. I will be the minority in jail, both because I am white and because I am older.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As I lie on my metal slab, shivering, I pray even though at this point I have no faith. Prayer is habit, from an earlier time, before God vanished during strip search. Please show me that this gets better. Please. All I can see is the halo of those horrible orange jail lights shining grimly outside on the concrete building. At least the lights tell me it is night-but of what day, I no longer know. I have never felt more alone, more devastated in my entire life. Never before. Never after. Not even in the worst part of my addiction, when I was isolated and dying, did I feel this alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Both Melissa and I are shivering. She has the added burden of being dope sick. She has to get up repeatedly and vomit. Between these episodes we talk. I am needy. To feel real, I must talk to someone. Anyone. I would have talked to Vlad the Impaler if he were my bunkie. "What is it about the quality of blood you most admire?" I might have asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Are you an addict?" she asks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Six months clean and sober," I say. I feel the unblunted cut of this sobriety as if I am being eviscerated from the inside out. Everything is too bright, too loud, too frightening, yet I am determined to walk through this without drugs or alcohol. Before, I would have picked up over a broken shoelace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm sorry for the . . ." She points to the toilet, where she has just had diarrhea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh no . . . I've been there . . ."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yeah," she says. It is hard not to hear a world in that word. Longing. Regret.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She is the sweetest woman with the tiniest voice. She is soft-spoken in a way that makes me think she had long ago learned not to make too much space for herself in the world. I need to keep talking to her, to alleviate the bleak sense of isolation. She tells me she is here on a warrant, that she hopes to go to court the next day and be released. She prays that they don't make her spend the weekend in jail before she can see the judge. We both know they will.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are silent for a long time. Then I break the silence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm afraid they will call you first and I will be alone."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Don't be afraid," she says. Years later, I still hear her voice exactly as it was.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But the fear of being alone with my thoughts is unshakeable and will follow me throughout my incarceration. The loneliness is palpable. A center-in-your-stomach loneliness, a motherless loneliness, one made worse because like all of me, it, too, is shackled. It can't take a walk. It can't be soothed by love. It is there to fend for itself.</p></p><h2>You Must Set Forth at Dawn: A Memoir</h2><p>The first African to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, as well as a political activist of prodigious energies, Wole Soyinka now follows his modern classic Ake: The Years of Childhood with an equally important chronicle of his turbulent life as an adult in (and in exile from) his beloved, beleaguered homeland.<br>In the tough, humane, and lyrical language that has typified his plays and novels, Soyinka captures the indomitable spirit of Nigeria itself by bringing to life the friends and family who bolstered and inspired him, and by describing the pioneering theater works that defied censure and tradition. Soyinka not only recounts his exile and the terrible reign of General Sani Abacha, but shares vivid memories and playful anecdotes&#x2013;including his improbable friendship with a prominent Nigerian businessman and the time he smuggled a frozen wildcat into America so that his students could experience a proper Nigerian barbecue.<br>More than a major figure in the world of literature, Wole Soyinka is a courageous voice for human rights, democracy, and freedom. You Must Set Forth at Dawn is an intimate chronicle of his thrilling public life, a meditation on justice and tyranny, and a mesmerizing testament to a ravaged yet hopeful land.</p><p>Wole Soyinka is a writer of global stature, the first African ever to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was imprisoned in Nigeria for his opposition to dictatorship. Soyinka is the author of Ake: The Years of Childhood and Climate of Fear, based on the prestigious Reith Lectures he delivered on the BBC.IBA&#x2014;For Those Who Went Before<br><br> ..... Outside myself at moments like this, heading home, I hesitate a moment to check if it is truly a living me. Perhaps I am just a disembodied self usurping my body, strapped into a business-class seat in the plane, being borne to my designated burial ground&#x2014;the cactus patch on the grounds of my home in Abeokuta, a mere hour&#x2019;s escape by road from the raucous heart of Lagos. Perhaps I am not really within the cabin of the plane at all but lying in a coffin with the luggage, disguised as an innocent box to fool the superstitious, while my ghost persists in occupying a seat whose contours have grown familiar through five years of a restless exile that began in 1994. For my mind chooses this moment to travel twelve years backward when, drained of all emotion, I accom- panied the body of my friend Femi Johnson from Wiesbaden in Germany, bringing him home in defiance of the unfathomable conspiracy to leave him in that foreign land like a stray without ties of family and friends. And the pangs that assail me briefly stem from the renewed consciousness of the absence of this friend, whose thunder-roll laughter and infectious joy of life would have overwhelmed those welcoming voices that I know await me at my destination. Despite the eternal moment of farewell by his open coffin in the funeral parlor in Wiesbaden, it was difficult then, and remained continuously so, to reconcile that self with the absence of a vitality that we had all taken so long for granted, his big but compact frame in a box, immaculately dressed as though simply from habit&#x2014;be it in a double-breasted suit with a carnation freshly cut by his chauffeur from the frontage garden, then laid ritualistically beside his breakfast set, or else in his casual outfit, its components no less carefully matched for all its seeming casualness, or his hunting attire, which appeared selected for a genteel English countryside ramble instead of a &#x201c;rumble in the jungle.&#x201d; Difficult to accept the closed eyes that would bulge at some inspired business idea, at the prospect of a gastronomic spread, at the sight of a passing generously endowed female, or simply when charged with a newly thought-up mischief&#x2014;but always lighting up the space around him. Still, I could not rest until I had brought him home, exhuming him from the graveyard in Wiesbaden, and the clinicality of my motions at the time made me wonder if I had left my soul in that alien graveyard in his stead.<br><br> It must be, of course, the coincidence of the airline that triggers such a somber recollection, in the main&#x2014;that final homecoming for Femi was also on a Lufthansa flight. And it was a coming home for me also, since my moment-to-moment existence from the time of his death until his reburial was in some ethereal zone, peopled by eyes of the restless dead from distances of silent rebuke. I came back down to earth only when he was himself within the earth of his choice, earth that he had made his own: Ibadan. And it is this that now reinforces the unthinkable and irrational, that this same Femi&#x2014;&#x201c;OBJ&#x201d; to numerous friends, business partners, and acquaintances&#x2014;is not in Ibadan at this moment awaiting my return, his sweaty face, black as the cooking pots, supervising the kitchen in a frenzy of anticipation, with an array of wines lined up to celebrate a long-anticipated reunion! Femi should be alive for this moment. If any single being deserved and could contain in himself the entirety of the emotions that belong to this return, it is none other than OBJ, and he is gone.<br><br> It is a long-craved homecoming, my personalized seal on the end of the nightmare that was signaled by the death of a tyrant, Sani Abacha, yet here I am, trying to find reasons for my lack of feeling, trying to ensure that it is not just a mask, a perverse exercise in control, this absence of the quickening of the pulse. It is that other homeward journey of twelve years past that stubbornly sticks to the mind, that of a friend forever still in a casket in the belly of the plane, I seated among the living but stone cold to the world, conscious of this fact but only in a detached way and wondering why I was still so devoid of the sensation of loss. It could be, I acknowledge, the aftermath of the battle to bring home his remains&#x2014;plainly, it had left me drained of all feeling. This return has not, so it must be that I have carried that home so obsessively in my head these past five years that I am unable to experience the journey as one toward the recovery of a zone of deprivation. The absence of Femi, who persists in looming large, a territory of dulled bereavement, is only a part of it. The adrenaline had been secreted over time, stored up, and then&#x2014;pfft&#x2014;evaporated in an instant, there being no further use for it.<br><br> One seeks these explanations somewhat desultorily, since I already acknowledge that this is not quite the homecoming I had anticipated, not quite the way my return had been planned, not this legitimate arrival, swooping toward Lagos on a normal flight as if Lagos were Frankfurt, New York, or Dakar. Surely it is not the same white-haired monster, that same &#x201c;wanted&#x201d; man with a price on his head, hunted the world over, who is headed home, steadily lubricated by the aircraft&#x2019;s generous bar. I continue to interrogate the featureless flatness of my mind&#x2014;compared to it, the pastel evenness of the Sahara Desert, over which we appear to be eternally suspended, seems a craggy, wild, untamable, and exotic piece of landscape.<br><br> I acknowledge that I am not much given to sentiment, but after all, I am not normally averse to being welcomed home! Indeed, I often wonder if, for others similarly embattled, homecoming does not gradually become a central motif of their active existence. For instance, I find I dislike airport farewells&#x2014;the exceptions have usually been preceded by some kind of tug-of-war to which I eventually yielded, often through emotional blackmail. By contrast, I am somewhat more accommodating with the motions of being welcomed back, though, even here, I am just as likely to be found sneaking in through the back door. Generally, my inclination is simply&#x2014;to have returned. To find myself back in the place I never should have left. Or where returning is no different from never having left, a routine recovery of a space of normal being, temporarily fractured, restoration of which has no significance whatsoever and requires no special recognition. In any case, each homecoming differs wildly from the last, and this goes back to my very earliest awareness of such an event, the end of a physical separation, when I first returned home from studying overseas&#x2014;on New Year&#x2019;s Day 1960, the year of Nigeria&#x2019;s independence. Then, feeling already long in the tooth at twenty-five, I had contrived to sneak home, to the discomfiture of parents, family, and relations. Normally, such a return should have been an occasion for celebration, varying from modest and restricted to festive and all-embracing, the latter gathering in distant clans and even total strangers with that ringing invocation that must have been adopted by the first-line beneficiaries of European education&#x2014;Our Argonaut has returned from over the seas after a long, perilous voyage in his quest for the Golden Fleece!&#x2014;or any of its hundred variations.<br><br> It is perhaps the sedateness of this return that continues to sit awkwardly on me, an abrupt usurpation of the other furtive homecoming that nearly was! Not that I regret the change, oh no, not for a moment! T&#x2019;agba ba nde, a a ye ogun ja&#x2014;thus goes the Yoruba wisdom&#x2014;&#x201c;As one approaches an elder&#x2019;s status, one ceases to indulge in battles.&#x201d; Some hope! When that piece of wisdom was first voiced, a certain entity called Nigeria had not yet been thought of. In any case, I appear to have failed in my ambition to &#x201c;grow old gracefully&#x201d;&#x2014;no more strife, no more susceptibilities to beauty&#x2019;s provocation, and so on&#x2014;a process I had once confidently set to begin at the magic figure of forty-nine, seven times seven, the magic number of my companion deity, Ogun. But at least I accept that there comes a moment when age dictates the avoidance of certain forms of engagement. That makes sense and is also just. There comes a point in one&#x2019;s life when one should no longer be obliged to sneak into one&#x2019;s homeland through mangrove creeks and smugglers&#x2019; haunts, and in ludicrous disguises!<br><br> I worry therefore about the absence of feeling, the absence of even a grateful nod to Providence, and seek some reassurance that my senses are not fully dead, that the emotional province of the mind is still functioning. I obtain a measure of relief, however&#x2014;indeed, I begin to worry now that the senses may be roaming out of control&#x2014;when, even within the recycled air of the plane&#x2019;s interior, overflying nothing but Sahara dunes and dust, I could swear, suddenly, that I already smell the humid air of Lagos, the fetid dung heaps, the raucous marketplaces and overcrowded streets. I am certain that I can hear, dominating even the steady purr of the jet engines, the noisy street vendors with their dubious bargains, see the sly conspiratorial grins of some as they offer contraband of the most dangerous kind&#x2014;and this had become routine even before I fled into exile in November 1994&#x2014;banned publications that they slide out from under the pile of other journals, like pornography in other places. Psst! They sidle up to motorists at traffic junctions and delays, with the mainstream journals on conspicuous display.

In this groundbreaking work Daniel Cl�ment has gathered&nbsp;nearly&nbsp;four hundred North American variants of the story to examine how myths acquire meaning for their indigenous users and explores how seemingly absurd narratives can prove to be a rich source of meaning when understood within the appropriate context. In analyzing the Bungling Host tales, Cl�ment considers not only material culture but also social, economic, and cultural life; Native knowledge of the environment; and the world of plants and animals.<br><br> Cl�ment&#x2019;s analysis uncovers four operational modes in myth construction and clarifies the relationship between mythology and science. Ultimately he demonstrates how science may have developed out of an operational mode that already existed in the mythological mind.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Daniel Cl�ment </b>is an anthropologist consultant.

Hig, bereaved and traumatised after global disaster, has three things to live for - his dog Jasper, his aggressive but helpful neighbour, and his Cessna aeroplane. He&#39;s just about surviving, so long as he only takes his beloved plane for short journeys, and saves his remaining fuel. But, just once, he picks up a message from another pilot, and eventually the temptation to find out who else is still alive becomes irresistible. So he takes his plane over the horizon, knowing that he won&#39;t have enough fuel to get back. What follows is scarier and more life-affirming than he could have imagined. And his story, THE DOG STARS, is a book unlike any you have ever read.</p><p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, August 2012</strong>: Adventure writer Peter Heller&#x2019;s <em>The Dog Stars</em> is a first novel set in Colorado after a superflu has culled most of humanity. A man named Hig lives in a former airport community&#x2014;McMansions built along the edge of a runway&#x2014;which he shares with his 1956 Cessna, his dog, and a slightly untrustworthy survivalist. He spends his days flying the perimeter, looking out for intruders and thinking about the things he&#x2019;s lost&#x2014;his deceased wife, the nearly extinct trout he loved to fish. When a distant beacon sparks in him the realization that something better might be out there, it&#x2019;s only a matter of time before he goes searching. Poetic, thoughtful, transformative, this novel is a rare combination of the literary and highly readable. <em>--Chris Schluep</em></p> <p><b> Amazon Exclusive: Author Peter Heller on the Star of <em>The Dog Stars</em></b></p> The inspiration for Jasper, a Blue Heeler mix, who is an integral part of this novel. <p> Our Hero, Hig, lives at a little country airstrip which he shares with his beloved blue heeler Jasper, and a mean gun nut named Bangley. It's nine years after a super-flu has killed 99.7% of the people on the planet. Hig sleeps out under the open sky at night with Jasper. He does it because he loves to see the stars, and because it's safer: if marauders come he won't be trapped in one of the nearby houses.</p> <p> He used to have a book of the stars, but now he doesn't, so when he's lying out at night he makes up constellations. Mostly they are animals, and he makes one for his best friend Jasper. The Dog Stars. It's Hig's way of reinventing the lost world, and keeping in touch with the things he loves.</p> <p> Jasper, to me, is the star of the book. He is fiercely loyal, and he gives Hig something to live for when there is not much else to hold on to.</p>Peter Heller is an award-winning adventure writer and contributing editor on Outside magazine, Men&#39;s Journal, and National Geographic Adventure.

It was a period when Western influence blended with, but did not dominate, a native tradition strongly rooted in the belief that nature gives focus and meaning to human life. Among the authors included are Naoya Shiga, "the god of the short story," whose four tales are written with an eerie lyric intensity that can rise to violence; Nobel laureate Kawabata Yasunari; and Osamu Dazai, one of Japan's best-loved modern writers. The title narrative, by Fumiko Hayashi, describes with compelling subtlety an aging geisha's decision to reject an erstwhile lover whom she finds to be coarse and money-minded. The seventh writer, with work distinct from the others, is Kobo Abe, born in 1924, who depicts a nightmarish urban landscape reminiscent of Kafka and Beckett, with alienation and psychic disintegration as his pervasive themes.

The sale would turn out to be one of the most profitable business deals in American history, and the generations that followed enjoyed immense privilege - but they were also haunted by suicides, cancer, alcoholism, and mysterious ailments.<br><br> More than 100 years after that deal was struck, Allie's mother Mary was diagnosed with the same incurable cancer, a disease that had also claimed her own mother's life. Determined to combat what she had come to consider the "Jell-O curse" and her looming mortality, Mary began obsessively researching her family's past, determined to understand the origins of her illness and the impact on her life of Jell-O and the traditional American values the company championed. Before she died in 2015, Mary began to send Allie boxes of her research and notes, in the hope that her daughter might write what she could not. JELL-O GIRLS is the liberation of that story.<br><br>A gripping examination of the dark side of an iconic American product and a moving portrait of the women who lived in the shadow of its fractured fortune, JELL-O GIRLS is a family history, a feminist history, and a story of motherhood, love and loss. In crystalline prose Rowbottom considers the roots of trauma not only in her own family, but in the American psyche as well, ultimately weaving a story that is deeply personal, as well as deeply connected to the collective female experience.<br><br></p><p>Allie Rowbottom received her BA from New York University, her MFA from the California Institute of the Arts and her PhD in Creative Writing and Literature from the University of Houston. Her work has received scholarships, essay prizes and honorable mentions from <i>Tin House</i>, <i>Inprint</i>, the <i>Best American Essays</i> series, the <i>Florida Review</i>, <i>The Bellingham Review</i>, the <i>Black Warrior Review</i>, <i>The Southampton Review</i>, and <i>Hunger Mountain</i>. She lives in Los Angeles.<br>"Rowbottom weaves together her family history and the story of the classic American dessert to produce a book that alternately surprises and mesmerizes. Despite its title, this isn't a bland tale that goes down easy; <i>Jell-O Girls</i> is dark and astringent, a cutting rebuke to its delicate, candy-colored namesake.... Rowbottom has the literary skills and the analytical cunning to pull it off. Like a novelist, she can imagine herself into the emotional lives of others, while connecting her story and theirs to a larger narrative of cultural upheaval.... The writing is lush yet alert to specific.... But then Rowbottom's book is too rich and too singular to reduce to a tidy argument.... Gorgeous."<br>&#x2015;<b><i>Jennifer Szalai, <i>New York Times</i></i></b><br><br>"We all come from somewhere, yet I never imagined that someone could come from Jell-O. From these beginnings, Allie Rowbottom has molded this generous book of intuition, connection, and grace. This is a work of wild insights and deep music."<br>&#x2015;<b><i>Nick Flynn, author of<i><b> Another Bullshit Night in Suck City</b></i></i></b><br><br>"The author's family's Jell-O empire brought wealth and privilege but also seemed to curse the lives of her grandmother, her mother and herself. With this fascinating cultural history of an iconic dessert and its creators, Rowbottom has found the courage to break the mold."&#x2015;<b><i><i>People</i></i></b><br><br>"A fascinating feminist exploration... a strange, sensitive account of trauma, motherhood, and America."&#x2015;<b><i>Real Simple<br></i></b><br><br>"Devastating.... Rowbottom's book doubles as a social history of the influential brand and its patriarchal messaging.... The mother-daughter portrait that emerges here melts the heart."&#x2015;<b><i><i>O, the Oprah Magazine</i><br></i></b><br><br>"Allie Rowbottom's memoir is an unflinching exploration of the inheritance and curse behind an American icon. Graceful and genuine, <i>Jell-O Girls</i> is what happens when a damn good story meets an even better writer."&#x2015;<b><i>Mat Johnson, author of <i>Pym </i>and <i>Loving Day</i></i></b><br><br>"To most Americans, Jell-O is a diner staple; the savior of the sickroom; the sweet "glue" for the fruit mold grandma serves at Thanksgiving. But Jell-O was a darker thing for Allie Rowbottom's family. Although her great-great-great uncle's purchase of the Jell-O patent secured the family fortune, it also molded its female members in ways that insidiously defined and confined. In this first-ever insider account Rowbottom mixes up equal parts history, sociology, feminist tract and personal mother-daughter story to create a literary treatise as clear and bright as Jell-O itself."&#x2015;<b><i>Carolyn Wyman, author of <i>Jell-O: A Biography</i><br></i></b><br><br>"Allie Rowbotton is a talent not to be overlooked! I love this book with all my heart. I couldn't put down this strangely sparkling cultural and family history"<br><br>&#x2015;<b><i>Porochista Khakpour, author of <i>Sick</i><br></i></b><br><br>"<i>Jell-O Girls</i> is an artfully crafted feminist excavation of an American legacy and its dark underbelly by a tender and perceptive memoirist, a keen cultural critic, and a deserving chronicler of her mother's legacy. Jewel-toned as its subject, Rowbottom's prose brings into crystal focus the lacerating toll of patriarchy in our media, our homes, and our own bodies. She is a talent to be heralded."&#x2015;<b><i>Sarah Gerard, author of<i> Sunshine State</i> and <i>Binary Star</i></i></b><br><br>"Rowbottom's keening book is at its core an act of devotion to her mother.... Rowbottom shares her mother's trenchant view of Jell-O's subliminal social programming, and her passages about the brand's marketing offer stimulating feminist cultural analysis. What gives her text its emotional force is the interweaving of this material with her own personal stories and those of her mother....

I love talking about myself. </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong>Wow, you&#x2019;re cocky, huh? </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> I prefer the term &#x201c;confident.&#x201d; </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong>So you&#x2019;re from Planet Earth, originally. But now you live in space. How is that, space? You like it? </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Totally! It&#x2019;s amazing. Every day is a new adventure. There&#x2019;s stuff out there in this galaxy that would, like, literally blow your mind. Giant monsters, strange planets, weird sports, evil robots, man-eating planets! And, I mean, I spend my days flying around in a spaceship selling hot dogs with my best friends&#x2014;what more could I want?? </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> The <i>Neon Wiener</i>&#x2014;that&#x2019;s your ship, correct? </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Yep! It&#x2019;s a lightning fast, super radical spaceship. But with one major difference from all the other lightning fast, super radical spaceships out there: it&#x2019;s a flying food truck! The side of the ship slides open just like any food truck you might see on the street&#x2014;that&#x2019;s how we serve doggies. It&#x2019;s also got like a million James Bond&#x2013;style gadgets. Like space mines that can be dropped from the back during a chase&#x2014;fun stuff like that. </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> Jeez, how big is this thing? Like <i>Millennium Falcon</i> big? </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Ah, I like your style. Well. . . it&#x2019;s not huuuuuuge, but we&#x2019;ve squeezed in everything a dude could need. We&#x2019;ve got video games, a zero-gravity basketball hoop for dunk contests, a batting cage where Humphree and I play Astro-Derby and launch z-spheres deep into space, video games up the wazoo. And, obviously, that is all completely necessary. All our fun stuff takes up so much space, Humphree and I ended up sharing a bedroom. </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> You have, like, a bunk-bed thing going on? I always wanted bunk beds as a kid. </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Sorta! We sleep in space hammocks. They&#x2019;re like regular hammocks, but spacey. </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> You&#x2019;re the pilot of the <i>Neon Wiener</i>?</p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Co-pilot. Me and Humphree are co-pilots together. </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> Aren&#x2019;t you kinda short to be a pilot? </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Next question please. </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> Tell me more about Big Humphree. </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> He used to be bad news, but now he&#x2019;s my best bud. He was a space pirate. Space pirates are totally not good. They hijack ships and they&#x2019;re basically just super huge and super scary. The only thing worse than space pirates? <i>Zombified</i> space pirates. SUPER bad news. Ran into some of those recently. . . </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> Yikes, so then what&#x2019;s the deal with your newest friend, Princess Dagger? She&#x2019;s evil, huh? </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Big-time evil. I met her when she hijacked our ship. At first I was like, whoa, I don&#x2019;t need this evilness in my life. But, after a while, she grows on you. She&#x2019;s tough as nails, just like her mom. Maybe even tougher than Big Humphree (but don&#x2019;t tell him I said that or he&#x2019;ll pinch me). </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> Princess Dagger&#x2019;s mom? Who&#x2019;s that? </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Blegh, Evil Queen Dagger. She is NOT good and is super ticked off that her daughter ran away with us. She&#x2019;s totally evil, totally hates me, and has really bad breath. Yuck. </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> Seems like it&#x2019;d get pretty crowded in the <i>Neon Wiener</i>. </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> You forgot about Goober! </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> Whoops, my bad. Tell us a little about Goober. </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Goober is my rubbery blob of a buddy. He&#x2019;s right here on my arm as we&#x2019;re talking; actually, he&#x2019;s <i>always</i> right here on my arm. He can never leave my side&#x2014;he&#x2019;s symbiotically attached! Goober can transform into all sorts of radical stuff: swords, bats, axes, whips, and stuff! He&#x2019;s always getting us outta trouble. </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> Favorite food? </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> For real, is that a serious question? Hot dogs! But I guess I can get more specific&#x2014;my favorite hot dog is Cosmoe&#x2019;s Classic Corn Dog: it&#x2019;s one classic dog, fusion-fired in cake batter with NO NASTY SPACE BUGS. </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> Would I like it? </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Probably. It&#x2019;s pretty tame compared to some of the other stuff we serve: bean slug-bugs, nuckto knuckles, moon cheese, raw arazkid legs&#x2014;some of it gives me the willies. But, hey, gotta give the aliens what they want. </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> Yeah, I&#x2019;ll pass, thanks. So, standard interview: If you could meet any person from history, who would it be? </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Easy. Luke Skywalker. </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> I meant any <i>real</i> person. . . Not a character from <i>Star Wars</i>. </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Luke Skywalker is totally real. </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> He&#x2019;s totally not. </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Look, do you live in space? Do you know what goes on out here? </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> Sigh. No. . . </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> So trust me. <i>Super</i> real. </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> It must be dangerous out there in space. Ever get scared? </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Are you kidding? Me? NEVER! </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> For real? </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Well. Well, no. I guess not. Sometimes it&#x2019;s crazy scary. But I just try to pretend I&#x2019;m not scared&#x2014;and if I keep telling myself that, it kind of works. One time this evil weirdo, Krax Von Grumble, almost zapped us to space ash, but don&#x2019;t worry, we played it cool and kicked some major space butt as usual. </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> Thanks for the interview, Cosmoe. Anything else you want to say? </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Hmmm...let me think. I&#x2019;ll end with a joke. Why don&#x2019;t aliens eat clowns? </p> <p><strong>MAX:</strong> Why? </p> <p><strong>COSMOE:</strong> Because they taste funny! Wooo!

By telling the history of this painting from its origin to the present day, Charles FitzRoy includes fascinating accounts of King Philip II of Spain and how his art collecting reveals a dichotomy at its heart. The painting itself is an extremely erotic description of the famous classical myth based on the account in Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>.

In the aftermath of World War I, the November Revolution, and the founding of the German Communist Party in 1918, Grosz also became the Communist Party's leading and most notorious artist. His bitterly satiric drawings of bloated capitalists, sadistic militarists, and fatuous government and church officials served as the focus of public controversy that landed Grosz in court on three separate occasions during the 1920s. In the 1930s, the Nazis denounced him as Germany's "Cultural Bolshevist #1." Here, however, Barbara McCloskey shows that Grosz's art and activities were equally, if not more, controversial for the Communist Party in whose name Grosz carried out his work. Drawing on Communist Party press reports, documents, and congress proceedings, McCloskey explores for the first time Grosz's changing involvement with the Party and provides a vivid history of the often tense and uncertain relationship between vanguard art and revolutionary politics during the turbulent years of the Weimar Republic.</p><p>Continuing her account with his emigration to New York in 1933, McCloskey documents Grosz's interaction with prominent members of New York's anti-Stalinist left, where conflicts with the Communist Party profoundly influenced Grosz's final rejection not only of Communism, but also of art in the service of politics. McCloskey's study of Grosz's role in the politicized art world of New York sheds new light on the cultural crises of the 1930s and the depoliticization and ultimate demise of radical leftism on the eve of World War II.</p></p><p><p>"This finely crafted and concisely written book is a major contribution to the literature on George Grosz.

Night is falling now and the piercing cold of autumn easily penetrates her animal-hide cloak. Outside, beyond the sheltering U-shaped bay of low cliff walls, the wind has picked up. These winds originated hundreds of miles to the north at the blue-white wall of glaciers that cover much of northern Europe.1</i> <br> <br> <i>Winter is coming and the shaman&#x2019;s people will have to move soon. The hides and supplies will be gathered and they will begin the trek toward the low-hanging sun and the warmer camps. But tonight the shaman&#x2019;s mind is fixed on the present and she waits. It is her job to read the signs the living world provides. It is her job to know the turnings of Earth, animal and sky. The shaman&#x2019;s people depend on this wisdom and so she waits to complete the task her mother suggested before she died. She waits, massaging the reindeer bone fragment in one hand and the pointed shard of flint in the other.</i> <br> <br> <i>Now she sees it, the glow over the eastern horizon. The great mother rises. The shaman waits to see the moon&#x2019;s face&#x2014;pale, full of power. There, see! She is complete again.</i> <br> <br> <i>From the crescent horns of many days ago, she has now returned, completed, to life. The full circle of the moon&#x2019;s face, promising rebirth and renewal, has returned. The shaman holds the bone fragment before her in the</i> <i>gray light. With her index finger she traces out the long serpentine trail of her previous engravings on the bone. Then at the end of the trail she makes tonight&#x2019;s mark with the flint-knife, carving the shape of tonight&#x2019;s full moon into the hard bone.</i> <br> <br> <i>Two rounds of the moon&#x2019;s dying and rebirth have now been traced out. The shaman&#x2019;s work is complete. The round of life and death in the sky, like the rounds of women&#x2019;s bleeding, have been given form, remembered, noted and honored. She returns the bone to its place beneath the rocks where she keeps the other shamanic tools her mother gave her so long ago. Now she has added to the store, a marking of passages, that she will use and pass on to her own children.2</i> <br> <br> <b> <b>WANDERING TIME: THE PALEOLITHIC WORLD</b> </b> <br> <br>The origins of human culture are saturated with time but we have only recently learned to see this truth. The evidence of the age when we grew into an awareness of ourselves, the cosmos and time itself had always been just out of reach. For most of our remembered history, the clues to the birth of culture and cultural time lay forgotten, buried a few feet below the ground. Then, in the late 1870s, the discoveries began and we started to remember.<br> <br>We first encountered the great awakening of our consciousness in 1879 in Spain when the nine-year-old daughter of amateur archeologist Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola led him to a cave at Altamira. Venturing inside, he found its walls covered in vivid paintings now known to be twenty thousand years old. As archeologists began systematic explorations, new caves were discovered, many of them also covered in paintings. The caves are a bestiary: bear, bison and mastodon appear on the walls along with other species. Sometimes these animals appear alone. Other times they are in herds. Sometimes we appear too&#x2014;human figures set against the herd, spear at the ready.<br> <br>These paintings gave voice to a heretofore silent past, showing that early humans were anything but &#x201c;savages&#x201d; incapable of representation, abstraction or response. This vivid prehistory, the time before written records, was set into a temporal sequence through painstaking work across the twentieth century. Radiocarbon dating allowed scientists to see when each cave was inhabited and when the paintings were laid down. As the sequence became complete, scientists came to understand how rapidly our ancestors had reimagined what it meant to be human. With that recognition, conceptions of evolution and the origins of the human mind were thrown open. Scientists began searching for some purchase on a new theory that could explain how the mind rapidly woke to itself and to time.<br> <br>Buried next to the painted walls, archeologists discovered artifacts worked by human hands. There were statues of women with wide hips, pendulous breasts and finely articulated vulvas, seeming to focus on the mysteries of fertility. Spear points, needles, flint daggers and hammers spoke of cultures skilled in the creation of a diverse set of tools for diverse needs. And on the floor of a cave at Abri Blanchard, a rock shelter in the Dordogne region of central France,3 archeologists found a &#x201c;small flat ovoid piece of bone pockmarked with stokes and notches . . . just the right size to be held in the palm of the hand.&#x201d;4<br> <br>The Abri Blanchard artifact would sit in a French museum for decades until amateur archeologist Alexander Marshack chanced upon it. Marshack was a journalist hired by NASA in 1962 to recount the long human journey leading up to the Apollo moon landing program. In his efforts for NASA, Marshack dug so deeply into the history of astronomy, he found himself at the very dawn of human time. He first became obsessed with the Abri Blanchard bone when he encountered it, as part of his NASA project, in grainy illustrations of forgotten archeology tracts. Eventually traveling to the imposing Mus�e des Antiquit�s Nationales near Paris, he found the small artifact all but ignored in a &#x201c;musty . . . stone chamber&#x201d; among &#x201c;accumulations of Upper Paleolithic materials, crowded under glass with their aged yellowing labels.&#x201d;5<br> <br>Marshack dedicated years of intense study to the Abri Blanchard bone fragment, rejecting the accepted wisdom that the notched carvings were nothing more than early artistic doodling. He traced over the curved trail of finely etched crescents and circles again and again. Finally he discovered a pattern echoing his own interests and his ongoing studies of the moon&#x2019;s impact on human life, time and culture. In 1970 he published a closely reasoned and convincing argument that the etchings on the bone fragment were one of the earliest tallies of time&#x2019;s passage, a two-month record of passing lunar phases.6 Rather than random doodles, the creator of the Abri Blanchard fragment had been marking time in a systematic way, for perhaps the first time ever.<br> <br>In caves at other sites across the world, fragments of humanity&#x2019;s first encounters with time were also found. Sticks with sequential notches, flat stones engraved with periodic engravings&#x2014;each artifact gave testimony to an increasingly sophisticated temporal awareness.7 It was in those caves, tens of thousands of years ago, that the dawn of time broke in the human mind.8<br> <br>Scientists call this era the Paleolithic&#x2014;meaning &#x201c;old stone age.&#x201d; The origins of human culture (and human time) occurred during the so-called Upper Paleolithic, from roughly 43,000 to 10,000 BCE.9 All human beings during this period lived as hunter-gatherers and left us no written records of their thoughts (writing would have to wait until around 4000 BCE). Through painstaking analysis and considerable imagination, however, scientists have pieced together the outlines of the Paleolithic human universe. Using the artifacts found at sites around the world and the narratives of contemporary hunter-gatherers, scientists have gained some understanding of these first modern humans.<br> <br>The Abri Blanchard bone fragment dates back from twelve to twenty thousand years ago, a time when the planet looked very different from the relatively warm, wet globe we now inhabit.10 It was an era when ice covered much of the Northern Hemisphere. France, as experienced by the unnamed paleoastronomer marking the moon at Abri Blanchard, was a realm of polar deserts, tundra and towering glaciers.11 Humans were scarce on the ground, and they struggled to endure the hostile climate. This was not the first time members of the genus <i>Homo</i> had endured climate change of this kind. Ice sheets had come and gone in the past, but something remarkable happened to <i>Homo sapiens</i> during the planet&#x2019;s last deep freeze that would, in time, alter the face of the planet itself.<br> <br>Somehow the depths and deprivations of the last climatic winter drove our ancestors to make revolutionary leaps in behavior. It was early in this period that human beings began burying their dead. Later they invented art and music. Clothes were soon fashioned by sewing animal pelts together.12 People began to invent systems for counting and, most important, started to codify the passage of time.13 It is in this period that the modern mind&#x2014;with its penchant for analysis and allegory, concretizing and abstraction&#x2014;emerged. Compared with earlier eras, the speed with which these radical changes swept through populations is startling and has led scholars to call the Upper Paleolithic the Big Bang of consciousness.14 Any understanding of the inseparable narratives of cosmic and human time must begin here, with the rapid expansion of consciousness that would one day embrace the very cosmos in which it was born.<br> <br> <b> <b>TIME OUT OF MIND: THE ORIGINS OF MODERN CONSCIOUSNESS</b> </b> <br> <br>The explicit recognition and representation of nature&#x2019;s repeating patterns were radical developments in hominid evolution. Thus, to understand the emergence of time in the mind, we must first understand the emergence of mind.<br> <br>The hominid species that came before us faced challenges similar to those facing our ancestors. From the fossil record, it appears that the earliest versions of <i>Homo sapiens</i> may have overlapped for a brief time with both <i>Homo erectus</i> and <i>Homo heidelbergensis.</i>15 It is also clear that until a mere fifteen thousand years ago we were in direct competition with a group of hominids who were likely also the descendents of <i>H. heidelbergensis, Homo neanderthalensis</i>&#x2014;the Neanderthals.16 This overlap with other species, particularly the Neanderthals whose brains were essentially the same relative size as ours, raises a pressing question: what spurred the Big Bang of consciousness in the Paleolithic era?17<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t the environment that woke us up. In the long stretch of time before the Paleolithic&#x2019;s cognitive revolution, the same challenges presented themselves over and over. Ice sheets grew and ice sheets retreated. Early hominid species adapted by changing behaviors as the situation demanded. What was lacking, however, was rapid innovation and learning. The toolkit of the human species was impressive compared to that of nonhominid species: the domestication of fire, deliberately shaped stones for cutting and scraping.18 But the pace of innovation in the development of these tools and the mental processes likely used in their development seems positively glacial.<br> <br>The basic stone tools our ancestors used 1.5 million years ago look fairly similar to those used by their descendants a million years later. Almost no technological innovation appears over the course of thousands of generations.19 On the other hand, comparing the brute stone scrapers used in 100,000 BCE to the needles, harpoons, arrow points and axes developed in 20,000 BCE is akin to comparing a raft to a nuclear submarine.<br> <br>There are many competing theories for the rapid origin of the modern human mind. One of the most fruitful lines of research comes from evolutionary psychologists who, in the 1980s and 1990s, began thinking of the prehistoric mind as a kind of Swiss Army knife. From this perspective the mind is remarkably complex and does many highly specialized tasks that it can only have developed in response to very specific evolutionary pressures. Researchers Leda Cosmides and John Tooby have each argued that, like a Swiss Army knife, the mind has different blades&#x2014;that is, different cognitive modules.20 Each module adapted in response to specific challenges our hunter-gatherer ancestors faced 100,000 years ago. These modules come with their own data and instruction sets&#x2014;they are content-rich. A <i>Homo sapien</i> child born fifty thousand years ago (or fifty years ago, for that matter) already had modules for hunting, social interactions, tool building and so on. Thus, each module comes hardwired with a considerable storehouse of data.<br> <br>There are compelling arguments supporting this claim. When a tiger leaps toward you from behind a rock, a mind built like a generalized computer sorting through all possible responses may not be the optimal evolutionary setup. A brain built like a Swiss Army knife, however, might very well provide the evolutionary adaptation to keep you alive. Given the notorious speed of hungry tigers, a Swiss Army knife mind with preloaded modules governing tiger recognition and the run-like-hell response would appear, on the face of things, to be a more successful evolutionary strategy.21<br> <br>There is also compelling evidence for this type of hardwiring. According to some lines of research, we appear to be born with at least four distinct domains of intuitive knowledge. These content-rich modules govern language, human psychology, biology and physics. In each of these domains there is evidence that humans evolved with an internal guidebook of understanding, a degree of hardwiring imprinted by evolution, to help us deal quickly with communication, social interactions, the living environment and the behavior of the material world.<br> <br>Experiences of high school science classes may convince many people that they have no intuitive understanding of physics. Psychologist Elizabeth Spelke would disagree. Along with researchers such as Ren�e Baillargeon and others, Spelke has explored the notion of a preexisting &#x201c;folk physics&#x201d; innate to us all. Spelke has shown that even very young children have a clear understanding of the behavior of physical objects.22 Though children&#x2019;s lives are built around (and depend on) interactions with other people, they can clearly distinguish the properties of people, other living things and inanimate objects. Most important, children seem to be born with concepts of solidity, gravity and inertia. From an evolutionary perspective, intuitive physics makes sense. From the flight of a projectile to the impact of two stones against each other, an intuitive grasp of physics serves as cognitive bedrock for learned skills such as tool making and weapon use.<br> <br>While the Swiss Army knife story of the mind&#x2019;s evolution is powerfully suggestive, it is likely not the whole story. Archeologist Steven Mithen has argued that the &#x201c;architecture&#x201d; of the mind&#x2014;its specific cognitive structure&#x2014;had to evolve in specific ways to drive the Big Bang of consciousness. In particular, Mithen sees the ability to move information between modules as the innovation that led to the modern mind and the all-important capacity for culturally invented time. Moving information between modules allows for metaphor and analogy, which are the essence of human creativity. When information is shared between modules, a lump of clay that is roughly in the shape of a human form becomes the spirit of a departed ancestor, some colored fluid splashed on a wall becomes a symbol for a bull felled in a fierce hunt, and markings engraved on a bone become a record of the moon&#x2019;s phases.<br> <br>Mithen likens the developing mind to a building with different rooms, each housing a different cognitive module. The story of the mind&#x2019;s evolution is a narrative of reworking its architecture. Only when the architectural plan of the human mind changed by removing walls between isolated modules could the rapid evolution of consciousness and culture begin. As Mithen puts it, &#x201c;In the [modern] mental architecture though...</p><h2>How to Be a Christian and Still Enjoy Life (Bible Commentary for Layman)</h2><p>Very minimal signs of shelf wear to cover, but all pages are clean, bright and intact.

Most know Richard Feynman for the hilarious anecdotes and exploits in his best-selling books "<em>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</em>" and "<em>What Do You Care What Other People Think?</em>" But not always obvious in those stories was his brilliance as a pure scientist&#x2015;one of the century's greatest physicists. With this book and CD, we hear the voice of the great Feynman in all his ingenuity, insight, and acumen for argument. This breathtaking lecture&#x2015;"The Motion of the Planets Around the Sun"&#x2015;uses nothing more advanced than high-school geometry to explain why the planets orbit the sun elliptically rather than in perfect circles, and conclusively demonstrates the astonishing fact that has mystified and intrigued thinkers since Newton: Nature obeys mathematics. David and Judith Goodstein give us a beautifully written short memoir of life with Feynman, provide meticulous commentary on the lecture itself, and relate the exciting story of their effort to chase down one of Feynman's most original and scintillating lectures. Photographs and diagrams</p><p>Richard Feynman, the rock star of theoretical physics, has left an image that belies his nerdy side. Not many bongo-playing surfer beatniks would have spent hours of their spare time proving Newton's law of elliptical planetary motion using only plane geometry. But <i>Feynman's Lost Lecture: The Motion of Planets Around the Sun</i> shows that the great man did just that. Originally delivered to an introductory physics class at Caltech in 1963, this 76-minute CD and book set contains everything the math-savvy listener needs to savor the pleasures of applied math. Caltech physicist David L. Goodstein and archivist Judith R. Goodstein found the notes and tape amid another professor's papers and set to work making sense of them; unfortunately, photographs of the blackboard drawings didn't survive. The book briefly covers their find and recovery work, then presents the proof as reconstructed--crucial reading if one is to follow the lecture. There's nothing easy about it, as Feynman acknowledges in the lecture: <blockquote> I am going to give what I will call an elementary demonstration. "Elementary" means that very little is required to know ahead of time in order to understand it, except to have an infinite amount of intelligence. </blockquote> He means, instead, that he is strictly using geometrical methods to reach his destination, which explains why it was so difficult to reconstruct without his diagrams. His charming Brooklyn accent and good humor show through in this lecture, even if the material is quite a bit drier than his fans might expect. Still, those interested in adding a new dimension to their understanding of this brilliant scientist--and those with a deep interest in Newtonian physics--will find <i>The Motion of Planets Around the Sun</i> a rare and unexpected treat. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>On March 13, 1964, Feynman delivered a lecture to the Caltech freshman class, &#34;The Motion of Planets Around the Sun&#34;why the planets move elliptically instead of in perfect circles. For reasons unknown, most probably for his own amusement, he chose to make the argument using mathematics no more advanced than high-school plane geometry. Isaac Newton had pulled off much the same trick nearly 300 years earlier in his masterpiece, the Principia. Feynman, unable to follow Newton&#39;s obscure proof, invented his own original, geometrical proof in the Caltech lecture. The subject of Feynman&#39;s lecture was the watershed discovery that separated the ancient world discovery that separated the ancient world from the modern world - the culmination of the Scientific Revolution. Before Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, the universe was Earth-centered. After their discoveries, our idea of the universe steadily altered and expanded, moving outward to the infinity we try to understand in our own time. Thus Feynman deals here with a crowning achievement of the human mind, comparable to Beethoven&#39;s symphonies. Shakespeare&#39;s plays, or Michelangelo&#39;s Sistine Chapel. Feynman conclusively demonstrates the astonishing fact that has mystified and intrigued all deep thinkers since Newton&#39;s time: Nature obeys mathematics. For thirty years this brilliant and seminal lecture lay dormant in the Caltech archives. Now, in this book, Feynman&#39;s lost lecture has been reconstructed and explained in meticulous detail together with a history of ideas of the planets&#39; motions. Anyone who remembers high-school geometry can enjoy it and can profit from the compact disc that accompanies this book.</p><h2>Infantry Aces: The German Soldier in World War II</h2><p><b>Here are dozens of gripping, never-before-told stories of battle in World War II&#x2013;from the point of view of the enemy.<br></b><br>This is an authentic account&#x2013;often in their own words&#x2013;of German infantry aces, common foot soldiers who were thrust into a blazing maelstrom of bloody horror such as the world had never seen. They faced the savage onslaught of fire-belching tanks at Kursk and carried wounded comrades hundreds of yards to safety through a hail of bullets. They fought alone behind enemy lines, tackled a foe vastly superior in numbers, and served as machine gunners in a thousand dangerous actions. On the frozen Russian steppes, under the scorching African desert sun, in the final desperate battles, they were outnumbered and outgunned, and faced impossible odds. Here are the fascinating stories of the men who stared death in the face during some of the most brutal battles ever waged.</p><p>Franz Kurowski served as a reporter in the German Army during World War II and has since written over one hundred books. He lives in Germany.Rudi Brasche<br><br>"Mount up!"<br><br>Unteroffizier Laupert, leader of the regimental pioneer platoon's 1st Squad, came rushing out of the makeshift battalion command post and ran toward the truck around which his squad had gathered. Feldwebel Wegener, the platoon leader, followed him on foot. Behind him came the other two squad leaders. "What's up, Herr Unteroffizier?" called Kneisel, commander of the first machine gun team.<br><br>"We're leaving at once. The bridge at Homyly must be taken before it is blown by the enemy."<br><br>The four Opel Blitz trucks, which were parked in a wood at the side of the road, drove off moments later. They left the main road and rolled along a field road. Rudi Brasche hung on tightly as the truck pitched and rolled. The first houses appeared before the trucks. That had to be Homyly. Soon the first shots were fired in their direction from the entrance to the village.<br><br>"Ready the machine guns. Polle and Gambietz take over the antiaircraft machine gun." Machine gun bullets chewed pieces of wood and metal from the trucks. Soon they could hear the shots. Kneisel and Nehring, the two machine gunners, ripped their machine guns from the side racks and placed them on the side of the truck.<br><br>"Faster, Grothe!" The Opel Blitz leapt forward. The village houses rushed closer. Rudolf Brasche saw the first smoking tracer rounds streaking toward the leading truck. Then the first burst of fire whipped from the MG34 mounted on the truck in front of them. The second machine gun joined in, and then the tripod-mounted MG15, which was actually intended for antiaircraft purposes, began to fire as well.<br><br>Seconds later the three machine guns in Brasche's truck opened fire. The noise of the three guns nearly deafened him. As Brasche watched, Ecklebe, the second member of the gun crew, loaded a fresh belt of ammunition. Then a burst of fire struck the truck. Heierberg cried out. He let his rifle drop and half fell on Martens, the second member of Kneisel's gun crew. The truck veered hard to the right. A house flew past on the left. They were now safe from the enemy machine gun. The truck came to a small wood and jerked to a stop.<br><br>"Get out and follow me!" shouted Unteroffizier Laupert.<br><br>Brasche grabbed the two ammunition boxes. He jumped down and ran after Nehring, the leader of his machine gun team. They reached the wood together with the 2nd and 3rd Squads. Feldwebel Wegener appeared from the fourth truck. The Holtsteger squad followed with explosive charges.<br><br>"Along here! This dirt road leads right to the bridge."<br><br>Breathing heavily, Brasche ran along behind his leader. They had gone no more than four hundred meters when they came under fire from machine guns and fast-firing cannon from ahead and to the right. Glowing steel whipped toward the German soldiers. Brasche and the others hurried on, following their squad leader, who ran into a stand of tall ferns.<br><br>In front of Brasche, Nehring fell to the ground heavily. The machine gun flew through the air in a high arc and fell into the ferns. Cursing, Nehring got to his feet, shook himself off, and kept going. The forest thinned out before them. Then they saw the bright band of the road, and finally the bridge appeared in front of them.<br><br>Four figures were visible. First Squad fired at them on the run. Three of the men returned fire while the fourth ran back across the bridge.<br><br>"Stop, stop! He's going to blow the bridge."<br><br>Two bursts were fired at the fourth French soldier. One caught him before he was halfway across the bridge and knocked the man face down.<br><br>"Across the bridge and dig in on the other side!"<br><br>Rudolf Brasche felt himself getting short of breath but he kept on running, always following his squad leader. They reached the approach to the bridge. Machine gun fire whistled in from the far end of the span. Kneisel threw himself down in the middle of the bridge and opened fire with his machine gun. The enemy troops quickly turned their machine gun on Kneisel. But the Obergefreiter was quicker. His burst struck the enemy position before the French could open fire and silenced the machine gun.<br><br>"Platoon, across the bridge in one dash. Go!"<br><br>Feldwebel Wegener jumped to his feet. Noticing movement behind the main pillar, he opened fire with his submachine gun while on the run. Rifle shots cracked from the riverbank. A man running behind Brasche cried out and fell to the ground. Then they were on the other side, and the fear that the bridge might blow up under them at any moment vanished.<br><br>An enemy soldier appeared ten meters to one side of the Laupert squad. He raised his weapon, but Nehring was quicker, firing his machine gun on the run. The Germans threw themselves down into the cover of the French position. A pair of figures emerged from the bunker, their hands raised.<br><br>Shouts drifted over from the wood that flanked the far end of the bridge. Then two armored cars appeared and opened fire on the bridge with cannon and machine guns. Bullets bounced off the steel buttresses and whizzed off in all directions.<br><br>"Infantry following behind the armored cars, Herr Feldwebel!"<br><br>By running and dodging, Feldwebel Wegener safely reached the hole occupied by the Laupert squad. Out of breath, he let himself tumble in.<br><br>"Machine guns open fire on the infantry!" he ordered.<br><br>The two machine guns opened up simultaneously. The enemy infantry, which had emerged from the wood, quickly pulled back again. However, two of the seven armored cars now turned and rolled toward the squad's foxhole. The two vehicles turned their guns on the machine gun position. For an instant Brasche saw a red-yellow lance of flame; it seemed to be heading straight for him. He pressed himself against the ground and heard the ringing impacts of bullets striking the steel of the bridge behind him.<br><br>"Pass a belt here, Rudi!"<br><br>Brasche roused himself and passed along a fresh belt of ammunition. Bullets clattered against the frontal armor of the armored cars. Nehring aimed somewhat higher. He saw the flash of the impacting bullets. All at once the enemy machine gun stopped firing. The armored car now turned its cannon on the German position and was soon joined by the second vehicle.<br><br>"Damn, what's the Holtsteger Squad doing, Herr Feldwebel?"<br><br>"They're on the other side. They should have put their antitank rifle to use long ago . . ." The Feldwebel's voice was drowned out by a sharp crack.<br><br>"That was the antitank rifle."<br><br>They saw the armor-piercing round strike the leading armored car. Smoke began to curl into the air above the vehicle. The armored car's ammunition supply blew up and the crew bailed out. On the far side of the bridge the 20mm cannon opened fire. The roar of machine guns and the crackle of rifle fire added to the din.<br><br>Richard Gambietz crawled forward to Feldwebel Wegener. Rudolf Brasche, whom everyone called Rudi, followed. Nehring and Ecklebe joined them.<br><br>"Kneisel, you hold on up front and keep their heads down while we work our way along those blackberry bushes, understood? When we're in the wood, shift your fire to the right so you don't hit us."<br><br>Kneisel fired, sweeping the edge of the treed area. Feldwebel Wegener left cover and crept as fast as he could to the left, where he disappeared into the bushes. Brasche followed along behind Gambietz. He saw Nehring appear beside the Feldwebel and disappear again at once.<br><br>Brasche felt his hands, which were gripping the handles of the ammunition boxes, becoming wet with sweat. He was afraid, but he knew that he would have to overcome his fear to be effective. The pace quickened. Brasche had to keep pace in case Nehring should need ammunition. Gambietz paused and turned toward Brasche. His young friend with the slightly pointed face tried to smile but only managed a grimace. Brasche caught up with him and moments later they joined Nehring. Just then they heard the roar of an engine and the pointed nose of a French armored car pushed its way through the thicket. They all saw the machine gun and the 20mm cannon.<br><br>Feldwebel Wegener signaled silently as Wegener looked his way. He raised one of the four hand grenades he had stuck in his belt. Gambietz nudged Rudi Brasche and pulled out a grenade. Brasche put down the two ammunition boxes. He screwed off the metal caps of two hand grenades and crouched lower in the shadows of the bushes as the armored car rolled directly toward him.<br><br>The vehicle came nearer and nearer. Then Brasche spotted movement behind it: enemy infantry, trying to approach the bridge from the flank under the protection of the armored car. The French vehicle was now 30 meters away. Glancing to the side, Brasche saw that Nehring had aimed his machine gun at the enemy troops.<br><br>"Go!" shouted the Feldwebel. Rudi Brasche jumped up and threw one of the grenades. Gambietz and the Feldwebel did likewise. The enemy were already firing back when the grenades fell on the armored car. Nehring opened fire with his machine gun. The three hand grenades exploded. Brasche jumped to his feet. A bullet whizzed past his head. Behind him Nehring's machine gun roared again. Three figures appeared in front of him. He ripped the porcelain knob from the grenade and tossed it toward the group of three. At the same time he threw himself headfirst to the ground. Brasche landed hard on a stump. The burst of fire meant for him passed overhead. The blast from the hand grenade silenced the three enemy soldiers.<br><br>On the other side, Feldwebel Wegener reached the enemy armored car and threw two hand grenades inside. Gambietz overcame a second group of enemy troops. Then it was quiet, except for the sound of breaking branches as the enemy fled through the woods. There was a fresh outburst of firing to the right and then from the far side of the bridge, where a squad had been left behind.<br><br>"Back ...</p><h2>Still a Kid at Heart: My Life in Baseball and Beyond</h2><p>As a catcher, Gary "the Kid" Carter's quiet, focused nature kept him out of the glare of the media's spotlight.

Berry lives in Athens, Georgia.Introduction <br><br>The division of house against house&#x201d; foretold by our Lord was never more complete and utter.<br> Union army recruiter, 1861 <br><br>By September 1861, the Todd family, once united and happy,&#x201d; was a wreck. Like the nation itself, they had come apart at the seams, leaving sister Elodie to marvel at the political world&#x2019;s destructive power. Sometimes it seems hard to realize all that has transpired in the last five months,&#x201d; she noted. It appears more like a painful dream.&#x201d; Elodie was a member of the Kentucky Todds. Her sister was Mary Todd Lincoln. Two of their brothers had joined the Confederate army. Elodie had made her choice when she had rashly become engaged to a Confederate captain she barely knew. Now, with Kentucky standing by the Union, she was trapped in the Deep South, cut off from her home and her mother. Her sister Mary seemed inclined to cut her off entirely. Stretched between the federal White House and the Confederate trenches, the Todds were a national catastrophe, and Elodie worried that worse was yet to come. Surely there is no other family in the land placed in the exact situation of ours,&#x201d; she lamented, and I hope [there] will never be [another] so unfortunate as to be surrounded by trials so numerous.&#x201d; Of the fourteen children born to Robert Smith Todd, six sided with the Union and eight sided with the Confederacy. Four of them were either casualties of the Civil War or had husbands who were, if we count Lincoln in that number. And certainly Lincoln should be counted a casualty of the war. Less obviously, but no less certainly, he should be counted a Todd. His contact with his wife&#x2019;s family was far more sustained than his contact with his own. His entire adult life had been awash in a sea of Todds. Not including his wife, he dated a Todd, loafed with Todds, confided in Todds politically and personally, benefited from Todds, and benefited Todds in turn. For all the important moments of his adult life the births and deaths of his children, the successes and failures of his career there was always a Todd around to slap his back or squeeze his hand. And it was a presence he counted on. From the house on Eighth and Jackson in Springfield, and later from the White House, the call to Come&#x201d; continually rang out from the Lincolns, and Todds came. Extending the survey to cousins, Todds introduced Lincoln to his wife and to the law; they plucked him from obscurity, marveled at his rise, and then followed his body to its deathbed and its grave. In short, the Todds were a critical part of the matrix in which Lincoln was formed.<br> He was not unappreciative. In the scramble for jobs presidential relatives did well,&#x201d; reported the New York World in 1861. In an unparalleled display of nepotism, [President Lincoln] has appointed his whole family to government posts.&#x201d; Mary Lincoln objected vehemently to such characterizations. These are villainous aspersion[s],&#x201d; she wrote of a later case. Mr. L. has neither brother nor sister, aunt or uncle, and only a few third cousins, no nearer ones; that clears him entirely as to any connection.&#x201d; Technically, she was right. With no brothers or sisters, with a mother who had died early and a father with whom he was never close, Mr. L. was unusually alone in the world. But in pointing all this out, Mary had only cinched the World&#x2019;s case. If the Todds weren&#x2019;t Lincoln&#x2019;s family, then who was?<br> And Lincoln was good to his family. Worried that the war would divide them, he had offered political and military positions to many of the Todd males, some of whom had rejected the offers and instead joined the Confederacy. Even then, he did not turn his back on them; over the course of the war he wrote multiple passes for various rebel Todds to come north, and on one occasion allowed Emilie Todd, the wife of a slain Confederate general, to stay in the White House, despite the ensuing scandal. The Todds became for Lincoln the emblematic family of the war: his attempt to keep them together paralleled his larger struggle to keep the national family together. From the Todds, he learned much of what he knew about family; through the Todds, he experienced many of the agonies of a family divided by war and shattered by grief.<br> In their grief, the Todds were not always as good to Lincoln. Even before the Civil War he was sued and slandered by Todds. Some of introduction xi them disliked him because they thought he would never amount to anything, and then disliked him even more when he did. During the Civil War, things got progressively worse. Sometimes innocently, often on purpose, a few members of the Southern wing of the family waged psychological war on the White House and used their connection to assail and scandalize its occupants. For the entirety of his presidency, Lincoln had to live down one after another humiliation at Todd handsssss.<br> Taken as a clan, then, the Todds were not always very nice. They could be pampered and prideful. They could be quick-tempered and vain. They made grudges easily, and they held them long. They were often preoccupied with the surfaces of things and insensitive to the substance. Mary Lincoln once described her sister Ann as malicious, miserable, false, wrathful, and vindictive. Glancing over the list, Ann recognized the traits instantly: Mary was writing about herself,&#x201d; she responded coolly. Sister Elodie was more self-aware, though no less critical. Above all, she warned her fianc�, I am a Todd, and some of these days you may be unfortunate enough to find out what they are.&#x201d; Of course, with his gift for language, it was Lincoln himself who most pithily lampooned the pretensions of his wife&#x2019;s family. One d&#x2019; was good enough for God,&#x201d; he quipped, but not for the Todds.&#x201d; The Todds suffered for their sins, however. Before the war, as North drifted from South, the Todds drifted from one another. The older sisters moved one by one to Springfield. The younger brothers moved one by one to New Orleans. The rest of the siblings remained in a Kentucky that began its career as a western state and ended it as a Southern one. Thus, by the time Lincoln was elected, the Todds found themselves strung across the nation&#x2019;s great divide; their experience of the war would be an emotional mess. But it was a mess on a grand scale. The Todds were everywhere in the war. They were present at Lincoln&#x2019;s inaugural. They were present at Jefferson Davis&#x2019;s inaugural. They were present at most of the war&#x2019;s major engagements, from Bull Run and Shiloh to Gettysburg, Vicksburg, and more. And they paid the price for their participation. Brother Sam was shot through the gut and died at Shiloh. Brother Aleck was killed in a friendly fire incident outside Baton Rouge. Hardin Helm, Emilie Todd&#x2019;s husband, was shot off his horse and died at Chickamauga. Abraham Lincoln, Mary Todd&#x2019;s husband, was shot in the back of the head at Ford&#x2019;s Theatre. As a family, the Todds lived the war in all its drama, division, confusion, exhaustion, and trauma more completely than any other. Indeed, if one wanted to write the history of Civil War misery on both sides from the perspective of a single family, one could scarcely do better than the Todds, who belonged, after all, to the first family of the United States.<br> The Todds, then, were a miserable family in both senses of the word. They were occasionally hard to like. They were not merely divided by the Civil War but shattered by it, left broken down, hollowed out, and haunted by ghosts. But this is the war as it really was: damage heaped upon damaged people. And all this partly deserved, totally self-inflicted suffering was all but irredeemable, except perhaps by Lincoln. In this respect, the Todds&#x2019; misery was critical. Though it achieved nothing lasting for themselves and only embarrassed the nation, it moved the nation&#x2019;s president. Despite and sometimes because of their disreputable conduct, the Todds helped to constitute Lincoln&#x2019;s understanding of family and, most important, his understanding of a family at war. In the trials of the Todds, Lincoln saw all the fractured families, and he took their collective grief and fashioned it into words that gave the war whatever redemptive meaning it has. When Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address, calling on Americans to bind up the nation&#x2019;s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan,&#x201d; he was talking, in part, about his own family. Two Todd brothers had been killed in the war; one Todd sister had lost her husband. There were two widows and seven orphans in the Todd family alone. In prescribing malice toward none&#x201d; and charity for all,&#x201d; Lincoln was addressing a nation of Todds, united by blood and divided by bloodshed.<br><br>This book is not a complete biography of the Todds, nor could it be. The historical record, especially for the early years, is too thin. Besides, following fourteen principal characters&#x201d; and their spouses, and their children over the course of a lifetime would be unwieldy. Of necessity and by design, this book focuses on the fates and movements of the handful of Todds about whom the most is known and with whom Lincoln had the closest association. And of necessity and by design it focuses on the war years, when the Todds&#x2019; tragedy played before a national audience.<br> Of the Northern wing of the family, particular attention is paid to two sisters: Elizabeth and Mary. Elizabeth was the eldest Todd and was like a mother to her younger sisters. It was she who first moved from Lexington, Kentucky, to Springfield, Illinois, and there established the seat of the Northern Todds. In the 1830s, Lincoln and Elizabeth&#x2019;s husband, Ninian Edwards, were up-and-coming Whigs together. Their relationship soured, but Lincoln and Elizabeth remained close all their lives.<br> The Southern wing of the family has never been studied. Most biographies of Mary mention the irony of her Confederate connections but nothing more. Here particular attention is paid to two sisters, Emilie and Elodie, and one brother, David. Emilie was called Little Sister&#x201d; by the Lincolns. She was their favorite and remained so even after she married a fellow Kentuckian, Hardin Helm, who rose to the level of brigadier general in the Confederate army. Elodie Dedee&#x201d; to the Lincolns was not as dear to them. She married her Confederate captain, Nathaniel Dawson, and managed to love the Lincolns personally even as she loathed them politically. Brother David was not close to the Lincolns at all. During the war he often said that he wanted to cut his brother-in-law&#x2019;s heart out. Together these Todds represent the full range of Confederate relations with the Lincolns. They are given the most attention, however, not because they are the most informative but because the most information has survived about them. Other Todds will be introduced, sink, and resurface as the limits of the historical record, and of narrative, permit.<br> What emerges is a portrait not of a family but a nation. Perhaps the Todds weren&#x2019;t always likable. Neither was America. But America punished the Todds for being representative of itself. The siblings who sided with the North were suspected of Confederate leanings. The siblings who sided with the South were suspected of Union leanings. It didn&#x2019;t matter how many of them fought or bled or died for their respective sections; still they could not do enough to prove their patriotism. To their contemporaries, the Todds&#x2019; division was not tragic or heart-rending but pathetic and disturbing. The family embodied something the nation wanted to forget that the war wasn&#x2019;t us vs. them&#x201d; but us vs. us.&#x201d; And yet precisely because the Todds&#x2019; experience was so relevant, the nation could not avert its eyes. The family received inordinate press coverage. They were the wound into which America couldn&#x2019;t help sticking its finger. And so the Todds lived the war in a fishbowl, as a constant source of speculation and scandal, even as their numbers dwindled, even as brother after brother sacrificed his last full measure.&#x201d; No family could have survived such a test. The war was an emotional amplifier. Whatever dynamics a family had going in only became more pronounced as the conflict dragged on. Thus fault lines became rifts and rifts became chasms under the remorseless weight of suffering. By war&#x2019;s end, there was little familial feeling left between the two halves of the Todd family. Emilie Todd, the Southern sister closest to the Lincolns, was the last to pour hate into the spaces love had filled. In 1864, she wrote a blistering letter to Lincoln, blaming him for all her family&#x2019;s misery. Her husband and two brothers lay buried in hasty graves, some of them in places she had never heard of. At twenty-eight, she was threatened with becoming a brotherless, fatherless, husbandless mother of three. The man who had made her so, the commander in chief of the Union army, was her own brother-in-law and, perhaps most painfully, the only man left who could help her. What could she do with such grief except to lay it at his door? And when, shortly after she wrote this letter, she learned that Lincoln himself had been assassinated, what could she do with those feelings but write to his son Robert to ask if he needed her to come comfort him?<br> The Civil War was a vast mosaic of such family crises. Across the country, husbands, brothers, and fathers left their homes to kill or be killed; wives, sisters, and daughters were left to tend to the dying, the newborn, and the fields. No family had ever experienced such dislocation; many would never be the same afterward. But the Civil War was a family crisis in a larger, more symbolic, sense too. In the nineteenth century, the language of politics was infused with familial meaning. Today, we rarely call George Washington the father&#x201d; of our country. Senators don&#x2019;t call each other brothers&#x201d; (and not merely because the brothers now have sisters). We don&#x2019;t talk about fraternal feelings&#x201d; or sister states.&#x201d; We don&#x2019;t talk about our national family.&#x201d; But once we did. In a still young country almost without history, these tropes grounded our nascent patriotism in the sturdier soil of family love. At every barbecue and picnic, ruddy politicians tight with whiskey and bloated with rhetoric reminded every man in earshot that he owed two great and reinforcing debts: one to his father for giving him a roof, an education, and a name and another to the Founding Fathers because he breathed free air in a world everywhere else ruled by tyrants and kings.<br> But by drawing familial meaning into civic life, such tropes made the Civil War all the more disturbing. A Union was breaking up. A House was dividing against itself. Siblings were seething with fratricidal rage. The familial metaphor no longer underlined national affection but national dysfunction. As Elijah Babbit warned his fellow Americans in 1860: Feuds which exist between members of the same families, where they do exist, are the most bitter of all feuds. Wars [between] the same people . . . are the most bloody, the most savage, and the longest continued, of any wars that take place in this world.&#x201d; And so it was with the Civil War. Americans hated Americans with an intensity that can only come from the perversion of former affection. Capturing the prevailing mood, Mary Chesnut penned in her famous diary: We are divorced, North from South, because we hated each other so.&#x201d; As with many divorces, the separation was protracted and painful; as with many, hate, like love, proved too cramped a category to capture the feelings of people who had lived together so long. And this is what makes the Todds so emblematic. They lived all the untenable emotions of a nation at war with itself. They were our nation in miniature a maddened family in a house divided, struggling vainly to hate its own blood.<br><br>Copyright � 2007 by Stephen Berry.

Some of the series&#x2019; finest lectures have been lost for many years, unavailable to the public in any form until now. <i>More Lost Massey Lectures</i> presents recently rediscovered talks: Nobel Prize-winner Willy Brandt discusses the dangerous inequities between developing and industrialized nations while Barbara Ward explains the origin and predicament of underdeveloped countries and Frank Underhill speaks on the deficiencies of the Canadian constitution. George Grant's talk on the worsening predicament of the West through an examination of Friedrich Nietzsche is joined by Claude Levi-Strauss on the nature of myth and its role in human history. Not only of considerable historical significance, these lectures remain hugely relevant in the 21st century. Also included is an introduction by veteran CBC producer Bernie Lucht.</p><p>Barbara Ward (1914-81), in later life Baroness Jackson of Lodsworth, was a British economist and writer concerned with the economic and ideological background of contemporary world politics. After studying economics at Oxford University, she became a writer and editor at <em>The Economist</em>. She was an early advocate of sustainable development and was an influential advisor to policy-makers in the U.K., the U.S., the Vatican, the UN, and the World Bank. She wrote numerous articles and books on the worldwide threat of poverty among less-developed countries and the importance of conservation. Her prolific written contributions to the development debate include <em>The International Share-Out, Defence of the West, Policy for the West, Faith and Freedom, Interplay of East and West, The Planet under Pressure, Nationalism and Ideology, Spaceship Earth,</em> and <em>Progress for a Small Planet</em> (1979). Frank Underhill (1885-1971) was a Canadian historian, social critic, and political thinker. He studied at the University of Toronto and Oxford University. He taught at the University of Saskatchewan from 1914 to 1927, and from 1927 to 1995 he was a professor of History at the University of Toronto. He played a notable part in the political life of Canada as a founder of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and as a prominent member of the League for Social Reconstruction. His publications include <em>In Search of Canadian Liberalism</em>, a volume of essays for which he received the Governor General's Literary Award for Nonfiction in 1961. In 1967, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. <p>GEORGE GRANT (1918&#x2013;88) has been acknowledged as Canada&#x2019;s leading political philosopher. He taught religion and philosophy at McMaster University and Dalhousie University. His books include <em>Philosophy in the Mass Age</em>, <em>Lament for a Nation</em>, <em>English-Speaking Justice</em>, <em>Technology and Empire</em>, and <em>Technology and Justice</em>. </p> Claude Levi-Strauss (1908-2009) was a French social anthropologist who became a leading scholar in the structural approach to social anthropology. Levi-Strauss was awarded the Wenner-Gren Foundation's Viking Fund Medal in 1966 and the Erasmus Prize in 1975. He was awarded several honorary doctorate degrees from prestigious institutions such as Oxford, Yale, Harvard, and Columbia. His books included <em>A World on the Wane, Structural Anthropology, The Savage Mind, Anthropologu and Myth,</em> and <em>Look, Listen, Read</em>. Willy Brandt (1913-92) was a German statesman, leader of the German Social Democratic Party from 1964 to 1987, and chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany from 1969 to 1974. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1971 for his efforts to achieve reconciliation between West Germany and the countries of the Soviet Bloc. His books include <em>My Path to Berlin: An Autobiography, The Politics of Peace in Europe, Encounters and Insights 1960-75, Left and Free: My Path 1930-50, Organized Lunacy,</em> and <em>Memories</em>.

Even after all these years, she still climbed to the top of this headland to wait for her man to come home. Two ships today, and neither of them his, but there were still hours of daylight left. She was not worried, for Gannon MacMagnus was a man to trust. He'd said he'd be home this day, and home he would be. </p><p> She'd missed him. Wasn't that absurd, to live with a man for nigh on thirty years, then miss him terribly when he'd only been gone a few days? He'd not gone anywhere unusual or dangerous, only to Skye to visit her brother Davey, then down to Ayrshire to visit their oldest son, Magnus, who lived on the lands the king had granted to Gannon so many years ago. </p><p> And there it was, the sail she'd expected and had hoped to see. Gannon's ship was approaching rapidly from the south, its rail almost under water, its white sail mirroring the foam at its bow as the black hull sliced through the dark blue water. But it was not alone on the sea, for there, in the north, was a second sail, one that made her draw her breath in sharply. A dragon ship. A longship, of Viking design, its wide beam and shallow hull bringing back a flood of unwelcome memories. Dark storm clouds billowed behind it, putting the square sail, red with yellow stripes, into high relief. She clasped her arms and ignored the chill that swept through her, reminding herself that it was not a warship -- those days were over forever. It would be a messenger from the north, nothing more. Still...She looked south, where Gannon's ship was nearing the entrance to the sea loch, and was comforted. Whatever the news the dragon ship brought, she and Gannon would face it together, as they had everything else life had brought them. </p><p> She turned to start down the slope, then took a moment to look over the glen that was her home, where she and Gannon had built a life together, binding the remnants of her family and clan into a thriving community. The sea loch was now known as Loch Gannon, which never failed to amuse her husband. But the honor was appropriate, for without him, none of them would be here. Across the usually placid waters, ruffled now by the wind, the mountains rose to the north and the east, protecting them from the world beyond. Below her the fortress grew out of the rocky promontory on which it rested, and to which she now hurried, hearing the horns sounding twice, first with the familiar notes that let all below know that the laird of the glen was coming home, then again, with the message that a ship was approaching and that it was not one of their own. Gannon had the men of the clan well trained, and her staff would know to prepare a meal to welcome him and his men home. But she would greet him -- and the visitors -- herself. </p><p> Rory, her younger son, tall, strong, and ready for the world, met her on the path to the postern gate, his blond hair catching the light, the same pale shade as his father's. He was so like his father. He had Gannon's chin, Gannon's blue eyes, his wide shoulders. And his impatience. </p><p> "Mother! Do ye ken who it is? Da and who else?" </p><p> She shook her head, not wanting to betray how breathless her headlong dash had made her. She often forgot that she was no longer young, but her body never did. "Aye, yer father's coming. But the other is a dragon ship." </p><p> Rory's eyebrows drew together, just as his father's always did when he turned thoughtful. "From Orkney? Perhaps with news of the queen's progress?" </p><p> Margaret's mood lifted at once. Margaret, Maid of Norway, only seven years old, was on her way to accept the throne of Scotland that she had held since she was three. "Of course. That's what it is. Drason did say he'd let us ken when she stopped in Orkney on her way to London. I'll just -- " </p><p> "Go to meet Da," Rory finished with a laugh. "As if ye dinna always do that?" </p><p> "And someday, my lad, if ye are as fortunate as yer father, yer own wife will do the same." </p><p> "Ye'll have to teach her to adore me, as ye do Da." </p><p> "Adore! He's been spreading rumors again, has he?" </p><p> She laughed with him and led the way into the fortress that Gannon had built to keep them all safe. Wooden walls at first, replaced over the years with thick stone walls, filled with rubble to withstand siege machines. And unable to be burnt to the ground, as both Inverstrath and Somerstrath had been. But she would not remember that now, any of it. Those memories belonged to a time past, when she and her sister Nell and young Davey had faced horrors no one should have to endure. When Gannon had entered her life and changed it forever. </p><p> She'd been Gannon MacMagnus's wife for twenty-seven years, had borne five children and seen two live to be grown men. Magnus, already married, was learning how to manage lands and people. And Rory was young, but Rory would do well, for Rory excelled at everything he attempted. All he needed -- eventually -- was a home of his own, and a woman to love and, yes, to adore him, for he deserved it. But that would come in time. </p><p> <i>Gannon's Lady</i> sailed into Loch Gannon under full sail, her husband at the helm. Margaret stood, as she always did, at the end of the dock, waiting for him, Rory at her side. The sky was darkening and the wind rising, bringing the smell of the storm with it. This one would be more than simple showers, for already the mountaintops across the loch were obscured, and the seabirds were flying inland, seeking shelter. The autumnal equinox often brought fierce storms, and this one, coming nine days later, looked to be no exception. Rory's hair was whipping around his head, and he brushed it back with a gesture that was so like his father's that she smiled. </p><p> And then Gannon himself was calling to her, his tall form alive with movement. As always, she saw nothing else. He wore the clothes of a Scotsman, plaided trews, knit leggings, and a saffron overtunic. He'd abandoned his Irish clothing long ago. Sometimes she herself forgot that he was of Ireland and not a native of the western shore of Scotland that had always been her home. But the painted carvings along the railing of his ship, Celtic symbols and Norse runes painted gold against the black of the rail, reminded her that he was her gift from the sea, Ireland's loss and Scotland's gain. </p><p> She waved in return, her smile wide. Her man was home and all was well...for a moment at least, for there, rounding the last turn through the barren entrance that hid Loch Gannon from the world, came the dragon ship. She recognized it as Drason's at once. The Orkneyman had been their friend since their fateful meeting that long-ago summer of 1263. Their friendship had begun strangely. They'd been enemies who quickly discovered that they were united in their hatred of Nor Thorkelson, Drason's uncle and the man who had murdered her family. They'd joined forces and had finally defeated Nor in a mighty battle on the Isle of Skye that was still talked about all over Scotland. Drason waved, but not with his customary exuberance, and her heart lurched. Whatever news he brought was not good. She was certain it did not concern Magnus, or her brother Davey and his family, for Gannon had just come from them. And surely not Nell, who was in Stirling to greet the child queen, nowhere near the Orkneys nor the sea. </p><p> But something had happened. </p><p> "Lass," Gannon called, as his ship neared the dock. "Ye do see Drason, aye? Send word to bar the door to the wine cellar. He'll drink us out of house and home." </p><p> She smiled, but saw Gannon's eyes narrow as he looked at the dragon ship and knew he saw the same tension in Drason's stance, that she did. Drason was wearing leather armor and a leather helmet that hid his blond hair. Not the garb of a man simply visiting friends, but what a prudent man might wear in uncertain times. She kept her silence, waiting while the clansmen caught the ropes and secured <i>Gannon's Lady</i>. She wrapped her arms around Gannon when he caught her in his embrace and kissed her for all the clan to see, his ardor never failing to please her. </p><p> He smiled down at her. "I missed ye, Margaret. How are ye?" </p><p> "Wonderful now that ye're here," she said. </p><p> She laid her hand along his cheek and kissed him again. He was no longer young, this splendid man of hers. There were lines around his sea blue eyes and gray at his temples now, but he still moved quickly and his back was still straight. He was still the most handsome man she'd ever seen, and she was the most fortunate of women to love this fierce warrior and have him love her in return. She smiled again as Gannon embraced Rory, clapping the boy on his shoulder. </p><p> "Tell me it's ye growing and not me shrinking," Gannon said to his son. </p><p> "It's me growing, Da," Rory said, and they both laughed. </p><p> "All is well here, love," she said. "It's good to have ye home. How is everyone?" </p><p> "Well. Everyone's well," Gannon said. "Magnus is learning how to run his own home, and Jocelyn is the same as she always is." </p><p> Which meant, Margaret thought, that their daughter-in-law, difficult at best, was as prickly and spoiled as ever. Magnus was a good man, but serious and cautious, and Margaret had hoped he would marry a woman with laughter in her soul, rather than a woman like Jocelyn. Still, she pleased Magnus, and what else could a mother want for her son? </p><p> "Yer brother sends his love," Gannon told her. "His pile of rocks is beginning to look like a castle instead of a rubble heap. It'll be a good fortress when it's finished. Davey wants ye to come and see it soon. Everyone there is fine." He looked at Drason's ship and his tone deepened. "We'll see what news he brings. Ye've heard nothing?" </p><p> Margaret shook her head. "No. Rory thinks it must be about the queen's journey from Norway. She was to stop in the Orkneys." </p><p> Gannon wrapped an arm around her. "That must be it." </p><p> "Drason himself," Rory said. "Must be important." </p><p> "W...</p></p><h2>Not the Israel My Parents Promised Me</h2><p><p>Harvey Pekar's mother was a Zionist by way of politics. His father was a Zionist by way of faith. Whether Harvey was going to daily Hebrew classes or attending Zionist picnics, he grew up a staunch supporter of the Jewish state. But soon he found himself questioning the very beliefs and ideals of his parents.</p><p>In <i>Not the Israel My Parents Promised Me</i>, the final graphic memoir from the man who defined the genre, Pekar explores what it means to be Jewish and what Israel means to the Jews. Over the course of a single day in his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, Pekar and the illustrator JT Waldman wrestle with the mythologies and realities surrounding the Jewish homeland. Pekar interweaves his increasing disillusionment with the modern state of Israel with a comprehensive history of the Jewish people from biblical times to the present, and the result is a personal and historical odyssey of uncommon power. Plainspoken and empathetic, Pekar had no patience for injustice and prejudice in any form, and though he comes to understand the roots of his parents' unquestioning love for Israel, he arrives at the firm belief that all peoples should be held to the same universal standards of decency, fairness, and democracy.</p><p>With an epilogue written by Joyce Brabner, <i>Not the Israel My Parents Promised Me</i> is an essential book for fans of Harvey Pekar and anyone interested in the past and future of the Jewish state.

But that's before one of them turns out to be murderous.</p><p>The bagpipes are blaring at The Spruces Hotel, which reopened just in time to host the Burns Night Supper, an annual celebration of Scotland's beloved poet, Robert Burns. In the midst of the long Maine winter, the festivities are just the thing to give local businesses a boost. But when the Scottish Heritage Appreciation Society arrives on the scene, their long-held grudges and animosity only grows as the whiskey flows. Then a fierce blizzard hits, trapping everyone -- angry Scotsmen, hapless hotel staff, and Liss herself. It isn't long before a body is discovered face down in a storage room, covered in tartan and blood. Liss and her friends must work fast before another body goes as cold as the snowstorm keeping them cooped up with a killer.</p><b>KAITLYN DUNNETT</b> first caught the Scottish heritage bug when her husband learned to play the bagpipes. Many Scottish festivals and parades later, and after a brief stint as bass drummer with a bagpipe band, she decided to combine her love of things Scottish with her love of writing.

The narrative structure, presented in cinematic terms, is currently getting attention in films such as Mike Leigh&#39;s Time Code, which featured four stories running simultaneouslySince his 1960 international breakthrough La Route des Flandres, Claude Simon has captivated readers worldwide with his relentless examination of life experience-in particular his own. Breaking from realistic narrative, obsessed with the power and betrayals of memory, The Jardin des Plantes is nothing less than an inquiry into what creates each of us.<br> While Simon admits that there are defining moments in life-eight days of battle during World War II were Simon's unforgettable experience-The Jardin des Plantes rings with his refusal to be defined by any single event. His thoughts show the complexity, the fabulous chaos, that make up the experience of life for Simon and, he insists, for all thinking human beings. Simon's memories-whether of everyday minutiae or passages from novels or the staggering experiences of war and death-unreel like films, constantly replaying or stopping and starting according to the whimsical or terrifying nature of his experiences. The juxtapositions may hold meaning or be nothing more than tricks of the mind. What is important is that each memory has a place in his mind and each has an effect on his self and the way he interacts with others.<br> <br></p><h2>Star Trek: Phaser Fight (Which Way, No 24)</h2><p>Readers choose their own adventure aboard the Starship &#34;Enterprise&#34;, where they can fight an alien race with Mr. Spock, investigate a meteor belt with Captain Kirk, and help combat a deadly disease with McCoy.</p><p></p><h2>Dead Ringer</h2><p>After her husband mysteriously disappears, Charlotte Gray learns that the man she married is actually an international terrorist - a discovery that sets in motion a terrifying chain of events, leading her to an enigmatic stranger who is determined to keep her safe - no matter what the cost.

Almost to the end of the war, the Germans had firm faith in the Enigma ciphering machine, but in fact the codebreakers were deciphering nearly 4,000 German transmissions daily by 1942, reaping a wealth of information on such important matters as the effort to resupply Rommel's army in North Africa and the effect of Allied attempts to mislead the Germans about the location of D-Day landings. Indeed, Winston Churchill hailed the work of Bletchley Park as the "secret weapon" that won the war.<br> Only now, nearly half a century since the end of the Second World War, have any of the men and women in this group come forward to tell this remarkable story in their own words--a story that an oath of secrecy long prevented them from revealing. In <em>Codebreakers</em>, F.H. Hinsley and Alan Stripp have gathered together twenty-seven first-hand accounts of one of the most amazing feats in intelligence history. These engaging memoirs, each written by a different member of the codebreakers team, recount the long hours working in total secrecy and the feelings of camaraderie, tension, excitement, and frustration as these men and women, both British and American, did some of the most important work of the war. These talented people share not only their technical knowledge of cryptography and military logistics, but also poignant personal recollections as well. Walter Eytan, one of a handful of Jews at Betchley Park, recalls intercepting a message from a German vessel which reported that it carried Jews "<em>en route</em> for Piraeus <em>zur Endlosung</em> (for the final solution)." Eytan writes "I had never heard this expression before, but instinctively, I knew what it must mean, and I have never forgotten that moment." Vivienne Alford tells of her chilling memory of hearing that the atomic bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima, and the stillness that came over her and her co-workers in Naval Section VI. And William Millward confides that he is still haunted by the work he did in Hut 3 nearly fifty years ago. "I sometimes wonder, especially during the night, how many sailors I drowned."<br> Few readers will finish this book without feeling that the codebreakers were essential to the outcome of the war--and thereby of major importance in helping to shape the world we live in today.</p><p><br><em>About the Editors:</em><br> <strong>F.H.

To lovers of folktales, it is fascinating to see such familiar motifs as the overflowing kettle (reminiscent of ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' and ``Strega Nona'') or the clever turtle of African folklore and Brer Rabbit fame appear within the setting of these North American folktales. The stories themselves are delightful, filled with such unforgettable characters as ``The Moose Wife'' who warned her husband, ``If you marry another woman. . .your hunting power will vanish and your new wife will soon be sucking her moccasins from hunger.'' Clever pen-and-ink sketches are an engaging bonus. This collection is distinguished by an excellent introduction to the Five Nations of the Iroquois, the place of storytelling within the Iroquois culture, the manner in which Iroquois folktales were collected, and the traditional characters that peopled them. Bierhorst has documented the process by which he constructed these tales. A three-page bibliography is included. An excellent combination of stories and scholarship. Constance A.

The author spent part of her childhood in rural Maine, where she sets the book. The optimistic and spirited main character, Rebecca Rowena Randall is sent to live with her two strict and dour aunts in the fictional town of Riverboro, Maine. Though she is, according to her aunts, more like her shiftless father than her accomplished mother, Rebecca&#39;s joy of life, in the end, inspires them. The enormously popular story was adapted for a Broadway play in 1907, and was made into several films, including a 1938 version starring Shirley Temple.</p><p>Author Jack London wrote Kate Douglas Wiggin a letter about her classic <i>Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm</i> from the headquarters of the First Japanese Army in Manchuria in 1904: "May I thank you for <i>Rebecca</i>?... I would have quested the wide world over to make her mine, only I was born too long ago and she was born but yesterday.... Why could she not have been my daughter? Why couldn't it have been I who bought the three hundred cakes of soap? Why, O, why?" Mark Twain called <i>Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm</i> "beautiful and warm and satisfying." <p> Who is this beguiling creature? The irrepressible 10-year-old Rebecca Rowena Randall burst into the world of children's book characters (and her new life in Maine) in 1903 when storybook girls were gentle and proper. A "bird of a very different feather," she had "a small, plain face illuminated by a pair of eyes carrying such messages, such suggestions, such hints of sleeping power and insight, that one never tired of looking into their shining depths.... " Soon enough, she wins over her prim Aunt Miranda, the whole town, and thousands of readers everywhere with her energetic, indomitable spirit.

A beautiful daredevil who thinks she can do it all--until she finds herself on the adventure of her life. A death-defying mission so risky, so audacious that no one would try it...unless the fate of the world depended on its success.<br><br>Thirty years after man's first lunar landing, retired NASA engineer Homer Hickam, Jr., offers a brilliantly imagined, endlessly entertaining return to space adventure in his spectacular first novel, <b>Back to the Moon</b>. In his bestselling memoir, <b>Rocket Boys</b>, Hickam memorably evoked our captivation with our nation's first halting ventures into space. Now he reminds us of the long-lost wonder with which we once watched America's conquest of the moon--and celebrated the triumph of mind, soul, and spirit that got us there--in this page-turning tale of the first moon shot of the new millennium. <br><br>Jack Medaris doesn't "borrow" the space shuttle Columbia to be a hero or a villain. A man of science driven by the memory of the woman who once inspired him, Jack risks his life, his name, and everything he has, to sidetrack the shuttle crew and take her on an unscheduled detour to the moon, where the secrets of his past--and the future of the world--await him. But when the meticulously plotted launch goes fatally wrong, and payload specialist Penny High Eagle further complicates Jack's plan, he must confront unforeseen challenges both in space and on the ground, where deadly forces are amassing to prevent the Columbia from reaching the moon.<br><br>Writing with the detail and intelligence that only an insider could have, Hickam takes us to places few have ever seen, strapping us into the cockpit of the shuttle and hurtling us into orbit and beyond. From the crackling tension of mission control to the savage emptiness of deep space, from the massive rocket engines capable of generating millions of pounds of thrust to the tiny killing machines awaiting a bygone era's orders to unleash their high-tech fury, here are the sights and science of space as you've never seen them before. Here, too, are the men and women of unfailing invention and intelligence who are soon caught up in the story: astronauts and attorneys, physicists and politicians, unsung heroes behind the scenes and shadowy agents of darkness behind the veil of history. And at the spiraling tale's isolated center are Jack and Penny, locked in a battle of wit and wills, rocketing weightless through space as their fates grow inextricably intertwined.<br><br>A no-holds-barred joyride of a thriller, <b>Back to the Moon</b> confirms that Homer Hickam is a master storyteller like no other, spinning a tale of high-flying adventure while expertly navigating the vast expanses of both the far-flung universe and the human heart.</p><p>Space is the final frontier--and its mysteries have fascinated Homer H. Hickam since childhood. In 1957, at age 14, he built his first rocket--and so began his space-age career, which eventually led to an engineering job at NASA. But in 1998, his calling blasted off in a new, unexpected way with the release of a bestselling memoir, <i>Rocket Boys</i>, (made into the mesmerizing movie, <i>October Sky</i>). Now, with <i>Back to the Moon</i>, the man-of-science-turned-memoirist dabbles in the world of fiction.<p> Despite its high-tech premise and lunar locale--<i>Back to the Moon</i> is no science fiction saga. It is, instead, a fast-paced technological thriller--filled with exceptional scientific know-how. (The author describes how spices are essential for astronauts because the normal aroma of food does not "drift into the sinuses or caress the palate in a microgravity environment.")</p><p> The space shuttle <i>Columbia</i> has been hijacked by an ex-astronaut and former employee of NASA, Jack Medaris. But Jack is by no means the bad guy--he has simply grown disillusioned with NASA, with its "timid" bureaucracy that no longer works for the good of mankind.

The book was compiled from a series of Heisenberg&#39;s lectures on the subject, and it is detailed and accessible enough for anyone interested in the subject. Heisenberg begins with a short history of atomic physics before delving into the theory of the processes and reactions within the atom. Nuclear Physics is an essential book to understanding the atom, giving readers an unparalleled look at nuclear physics from one of the greatest scientific minds of the twentieth century. A controversial WWII figure, Werner Heisenberg was a German physicist. Born in 1901 to an academic family, Heisenberg was interested in scientific and philosophical pursuits from a young age. After graduating from the University of Munich, where he studied under physicist Arthur Sommerfield, Heisenberg went on to establish a career in the study of atomic and particle theory. He won the Nobel Prize in 1932 for his Uncertainty Principle. Heisenberg was one of the top German scientists during World War II, and he worked as the director of the German Uranium Project developing an atomic bomb for Germany. He did not succeed in this effort, however, before the end of the war. He was incarcerated from 1945-46 for his role in the Nazi regime, but in the &#39;50s and &#39;60s, Heisenberg continued to contribute his research to the field of nuclear physics. He retired in 1970 and resided in Munich until his death in 1973.</p><p></p><h2>Cherry Ames, At Hilton Hospital: Book 13</h2><p><p>One of the strangest cases of Cherry Ames' absorbing career comes her way while working as a staff nurse at Hilton Hospital in her home town.

Anticipating that their regimes would eliminate a common enemy--namely Marxist-Leninist communism--two popes essentially collaborated with Hitler, Mussolini, and the fascist dictators in Spain (Franco) and Croatia (Paveli&#x107;).This is the damning indictment of this well-researched polemic, which for almost five decades in Germany has sparked controversy, outrage, and furious debate. Now it is available in English for the first time.Many will dismiss Deschner--who himself was raised and educated in a pious Catholic tradition--as someone who is obsessed with exposing the failings of the church of his upbringing. But he has marshaled so many facts and presented them with such painstaking care that his accusations cannot easily be ignored.The sheer weight of the evidence that he has brought together in this book raises a host of questions about a powerful institution that continues to exercise political influence to this day.</p><p><b>Karlheinz Deschner</b>&nbsp;(Hassfurt am Main, Germany)&nbsp;is the author or editor of forty-six books including novels, literary criticism, essays, aphorisms, and, above all, critical history of religion and the church.&nbsp; He is best known for his multivolume <i>Criminal History of Christianity</i>, the tenth volume of which was published in March 2013. He has enthralled and provoked his audiences over the years with more than two thousand public lectures. In 1971 he was called before a court in Nuremberg, charged with &#x201c;insulting the Church.&#x201d; He is the first German to be recognized with the International Humanist Award.

In his thrillingly written work, he was the first renowned author to document the close collaboration between the Catholic Church and the Fascists, which, in the Balkans for instance, led to probably the best-concealed mass crimes of modern times.

Not illustrated. 1918 Excerpt: ...the subject-matter of the previous chapter, and how our Lord after His terrible prediction upon Jerusalem, added, &#39;Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. For I say unto you, Ye shall not see Me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.&#39; &#34;This is Jewish, of course, but the whole matter of the future of the Jews and of the return of the Lord for His Church, and, later on, with His Church, are bound up together. Presently, after uttering His last prediction, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, &#34;&#39;Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world?&#34; &#34;Keep your Bibles open where you now have them, friends, and note this--that the two-fold answer of our Lord&#39;s is in the reverse order to the disciples&#39; question. In verses four and five He points out what should not be the sign of His coming. While, in verse six, He shows what should not be the sign of the end of the world. With these distinctions I shall have more to say another day. &#34;This afternoon I want to keep close to the signs of the coming of the Lord. Read then the thirty-second and third verses: &#39;Now learn a parable of the fig-tree: when its branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that&#39;--look in the margins of your Bible, please, and note that the &#39;it&#39; of the text becomes &#39;He,&#39; which is certainly the only wise translation--&#39;when ye shall see all these things, know that He is near, even at your doors.&#39; &#34;Now, I hardly need remind the bulk of you, friends, gathered here this afternoon, that the figtree, in the Gospels, represents Israel.

Eberle has become known internationally as a teacher to the Body of Christ. Having traveled extensively and authoring several books, he has influenced leaders&#x2019; lives all over the world. His passion is for the maturation of the Church. In this seven volume series, Harold explains the spiritual world from a Christian perspective. He deals with issues such as: <p> What exists in the spiritual world<br> How people access that realm<br> Discerning things in the spirit<br> Activities of witches, psychics and New Agers<br> The Christian perspective of holistic medicine<br> Spiritual impartations and influences between people<br> Out-of-the-body experiences<br> Interpretation of dreams<br> What the dead are experiencing<br> Angelic and demonic visitations<br> Understanding supernatural phenomena from a Biblical perspective<br></p></p><p>Remove the supernatural from Christianity and you no longer have Christianity. Without the miraculous and the spiritual aspects recorded in the Bible you have very few pages left of the Holy Book. Still, many Christians deny present-day experiences related to the spiritual world. Or at best, they are defensive and fearful about the supernatural realm, not wanting to talk about it and warning everyone to stay away. <p> At the same time the general population is intrigued with spiritual realities. Popular television programs are incorporating supernatural phenomena and paranormal experiences into the lives of their actors. The New Age Movement, which emphasizes the spiritual dimension in an anti-Christian context, is spreading at a phenomenal rate worldwide. Young people surrounding us are being reared on videos portraying every aspect pertaining to the invisible dimension. Occult and various mystical teachings are a part of their daily diets. The world is paying money to witness mystical phenomena reported in magazines and portrayed in our movie theaters. This should tell us something, since Jesus said that where a person's money is, there is his heart. People give themselves to these things because they are hungry for spiritual reality. </p><p> It is time for the Church to offer God's answers to the people around us who are hungering. We must not allow evil men and women to fill the void. It is not enough for Christians to give warnings concerning this cult or that deception. Our Christian bookstores have volumes and volumes written on the dangers associated with the New Age groups, and those warnings should be taken seriously. However, our whole outlook must change. So long as we are on the defensive, we will not win this generation to our Lord Jesus Christ. We do not need another writing cautioning us to stay away from evil powers. We must get on the offensive. </p><p> Most importantly, it is time that we prepare the Church for an increase of the supernatural in Her midst. I am writing with a belief that God is beginning to move in new power among His people. In the past, we have seen various gifts of the Holy Spirit, but it is our hope and faith that before the return of Jesus Christ, the Church will arise to a place of maturity, during which She will do the very works of Jesus, and greater works (John 14:12). We will indeed see God move in power, showing signs and wonders that previously have not been seen in the earth. </p><p> It is time Christians understand and learn how to experience the supernatural in a greater measure. One of the most outstanding features we see in the lives of the men and women in the Bible is the spiritual phenomena that accompanied them. Just as Moses shamed Pharaoh's magicians, so also Christians should be able to demonstrate the power of God and shame the mystics and false prophets of our days. We do not need to be warned about evil as much as we need to be taught about God's power. Since the kingdom of light is greater than all darkness, it is time we rise up to a higher level of spiritual awareness and tap into that which God is offering to us. </p><p> Our textbook will be the Bible. The Bible is the most comprehensive and accurate book that reveals how the spiritual world influences us. By using it, we can come to a clearer understanding of spiritual dynamics than by reading all the occult and New Age books that have ever been published. The answers that people are seeking for are right there in the Book of all books. </p><p> In order to cover all the necessary information, we have had to divide our teachings into seven volumes. It is difficult to separate the individual topics, because the information presented in the earlier volumes is needed to fully understand later materials. We know that some readers will be tempted to jump ahead and investigate areas of particular interest, but we do not want you to misunderstand later truths which depend upon points made earlier. Please keep in mind that this entire set is written in a progressive manner, building one truth upon another. </p><p> The various volumes of this book are written so they can either be studied by an individual or taught in a group setting. </p><p> It is my belief that Christians are hungry to learn about the spiritual world. Every time I have taught on this subject to various Christian groups, the response has been shockingly favorable. People have many unanswered questions in this area because we have not talked about them openly. </p><p> In the Old Testament times among the Jewish people, there were various "Schools of the Prophets." No one knows for sure what was actually studied in such gatherings, but certainly those with spiritual inclinations learned much about the workings of God and the invisible world. We hope this book will be of similar value, but we call this the "School of the Spirit."

There are many "Complete Books" or "Guides" available (e.g., John Howard's The Cyclist's Companion , LJ 6/15/84; Michael Shermer's Sport Cycling , LJ 7/85), but this one is by far the most comprehensive. It is excellent for those who want to purchase a bike (with an exhaustive chapter on fitting the bike), race, ride for fun, and perform minor maintenance. It also has interesting stories by and about LeMond and is well illustrated. If you buy one bicycling book this year, this should be it. Highly recommended. Thomas K.

But families don&#x2019;t just grow, they grow old, and the clan&#x2019;s matriarch, Joy, is not slipping into old age with the quiet grace her children, Molly and Daniel, would have wished. When Joy&#x2019;s beloved husband dies, Molly and Daniel have no shortage of solutions for their mother&#x2019;s loneliness and despair, but there is one challenge they did not count on: the reappearance of an ardent suitor from Joy&#x2019;s college days. And they didn&#x2019;t count on Joy herself, a mother suddenly as willful and rebellious as their own kids.</p><p>The <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author Cathleen Schine has been called &#x201c;full of invention, wit, and wisdom that can bear comparison to [ Jane] Austen&#x2019;s own&#x201d; (<i>The New York Review of Books</i>), and she is at her best in this intensely human, profound, and honest novel about the intrusion of old age into the relationships of one loving but complicated family. <i>They May Not Mean To, But They Do </i>is a radiantly compassionate look at three generations, all coming of age together.</p></p><p>CATHLEEN SCHINE is the author of <i>The Three Weissmanns of Westport</i>, <i>The Love Letter</i>, and <i>The New Yorkers</i>, among other novels. She has contributed to <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The New York</i> <i>Review of Books</i>, <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, and <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>. She lives in Los Angeles.<p>Praise for <i>They May Not Mean To, But They Do</i></p><p>&#x201c;Cathleen Schine [is] one of our most realistically imaginative, dependably readable novelists. . . [H]er ten books comprise a sly, illuminating corpus that seems more related to the English comic novel than to most contemporary American fiction. [S]hapely and precisely structured. . . ruefully satiric. . . buoyant. . . sharply observant. . . Her tenth and newest novel . . . cuts deeper, feels fuller and more ambitious, and seems to me her best.&#x201d; &#x2015;Phillip Lopate, <i>New York Review of Books</i></p><p>&#x201c;Schine&#x2019;s painfully beautiful depiction of a woman&#x2019;s heroism in the face of that abyss offers, like the best literature, a reminder of the tender, frightening vulnerability we all share.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></p><p>&#x201c;This marvelous novel is emotionally stirring and hilarious on virtually every page. How does Cathleen Schine know everything about everything? Her observations about family life, friendship, loss, aging, dignity, indignity, and the attachments we miraculously make that never seem to unattach are profound and rewarding. I already miss living in the world of this special and winning book.&#x201d; &#x2015;Meg Wolitzer, author of <i>The Interestings</i></p><p>&#x201c;Cathleen Schine has written an entirely different kind of coming-of-age novel. This is not about how a twentysomething becomes a thirtysomething. It&#x2019;s about how people making the difficult and at times scary journey into old old age figure out how to live. And it&#x2019;s about the people who surround them&#x2015;with love, anxiety, resentment, and sometimes complete misunderstanding. <i>They May Not Mean To, But They Do</i> is a great read: empathetic, and also very, very funny.&#x201d; &#x2015;Roz Chast, author of <i>Can&#x2019;t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?</i></p><p>&#x201c;Oh, but you do need Schine's novel. At least, you do if you're a reader who relishes acute psychological perceptions and lots of laughs to leaven the existential grimness, like those other literary domestic goddesses to whom she's sometimes compared, Jane Austen and Nora Ephron . . . Does anyone really ever do anyone else any good? That's the question this sparkling and sad novel mulls over and answers with a wry shrug.&#x201d; &#x2015;Maureen Corrigan, <i>NPR</i></p><p><i>"They May Not Mean To, But They Do</i> is a very funny novel. . .This is a situation plenty of readers will recognize. . . Schine reminds us that a family is as united by its trials as by its triumphs. . . Schine writes with economy and style . . . [D]eftly handled storytelling.&#x201d; &#x2015;Penelope Lively, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is one of those laugh-out-loud-on-the-subway novels, but it also manages to be sad and authentic . . .

Replete with aging parents, grandchildren growing up faster than one would like, and adult children wanting to take charge but being stifles by their mother&#x2019;s stubbornness, this could be any reader&#x2019;s clan. In addition, Schine&#x2019;s ability to shift seamlessly from one person&#x2019;s point of view to another&#x2019;s adds depth and richness.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;With its unexpected moments of profundity and laugh-aloud humor, Cathleen Schine&#x2019;s novel movingly demonstrates how parents and children may not mean to but they do, ultimately, strain yet sustain one another.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lilith Magazine</i></p><p>Praise for <i>Fin &amp; Lady</i></p><p>"Schine's writing sparkles, and her finale proves as unexpected and luminous as love itself." &#x2015;<i>People</i></p><p>"Weighty themes are addressed with subtlety and grace . . .

Schine&#x2019;s homage [to Jane Austen] has it all: stinging social satire, mordant wit, delicate charm, lilting language and cosseting materialistic detail . . . Schine is clearly a writer who loves to read as much as she loves to write. And it is great fun to play English major with her.&#x201d; &#x2015;Dominique Browning, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"A clever, frothy novel . . . Schine playfully probes the lies, self-deceptions, and honorable hearts of her characters." &#x2015;<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p>"Schine is perceptive, even breathtaking, in her observations." &#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p></p><h2>The Nature of New Hampshire: Natural Communities of the Granite State (UNH Non-Series Title)</h2><p>This illuminating and instructive book explores New Hampshire&#x2019;s stunning mosaic of natural communities.

Though these trails are little known compared to those in the nearby Canadian Rocky Mountain national parks, the scenery is equally beautiful. Includes Peter Lougheed, Spray Valley, and Bow Valley provincial parks. Discerning trail reviews help you choose your trip. Detailed route descriptions keep you on the path. Includes 15 shoulder-season hikes. 140 color photos and trail maps for each hike. Don&#39;t miss the circuit of Tent Ridge, crossing eight folkloric bridges over Galatea Creek, starting into the alpine from the Rockies&#39; highest pass, or the world-class route over Northover Ridge.</p><p>Kathy and Craig are dedicated to each other, and to hiking, in that order. Their second date was a 32-km (20-mile) dayhike in Arizona. Since then they haven t stopped for long. <p>They've trekked through much of the world s vertical topography, including the Himalayas, Patagonian Andes, Pyrenees, French Alps, Scottish Highlands, Dolomites, Costa Blanca Mountains, Sierra Nevada, North Cascades, Colorado Rockies, New Zealand, and canyons of the American Southwest. In 1989, they moved from the U.S. to Canada, so they could live near the Canadian Rockies the range that inspired the first of their refreshingly unconventional guidebooks. </p><p>While living in Vancouver, British Columbia, they explored the Coast Mountains and the North Cascades, then wrote hiking guidebooks on each of those ranges. Later, while living in a cabin on fiord-like Kootenay Lake (between B.C.'s Purcell and Selkirk mountains), they researched and wrote a hiking guidebook on that area. </p><p> Kathy and Craig have since returned to the Canadian Rockies and now live in Canmore, Alberta. Their desire to hike, however, keeps them travelling constantly. For example, they migrate each spring and fall to the high-desert canyon country of southern Utah. Their guidebook on that sensual, other-worldly landscape is especially stimulating. </p><p>Kathy and Craig agree: no matter how arduous the trail, or how severe the conditions, hiking is the easiest of the many tasks necessary to create a guidebook. What they find most challenging is having to sit. They spend twice as much time at their computers writing, organizing, editing, checking facts, rewriting, re-organizing, re-editing, re-checking facts as they do on the trail. </p><p>The result is worth it. Kathy and Craig's colourful writing, opinionated commentary, and enthusiasm for the joys of hiking make their guidebooks uniquely helpful and compelling. </p><p> Go to their website at hikingcamping.

Instead, they&#x2019;ve spent their time trying to prove that they really do care. Now, political scientist William Voegeli turns the tables on this argument, making the case that &#x201c;compassion&#x201d; is neither the essence of personal virtue, nor the ultimate purpose of government.</p><p>Liberals have built a remarkable edifice of government programs that are justified by appeals to compassion. Yet as Voegeli shows, they are indifferent whether these programs fail or succeed. Instead, when the problems these programs are created to solve fail to disappear, they propose to fix underperforming programs with more money, or more programs. Meanwhile, conservatives who challenge their effectiveness on practical grounds are met with charges of being &#x201c;heartless right wingers.&#x201d;</p><p>Voegeli explores various programs that have become battlefields between Conservatives fighting for more efficiency, and Liberals fighting for the status quo. Along the way, he explains the philosophical underpinnings of the Liberal project that created and reinforce this misapplied ideal of compassion, and why, without a major change, Liberals must be considered unfit to govern.</p></p><p><p>When liberals don't have reason, authority, or the American people on their side, they turn to the one thing they never run out of: Pity.</p><p>For decades, conservatives have chafed at being called "heartless" and "uncaring" by liberals who maintain that our essential choice as a nation is between the politics of kindness and the politics of cruelty. In <em>The Pity Party</em>, political scientist William Voegeli turns the tables on this argument, making the case that "compassion" is neither the essence of personal virtue nor the ultimate purpose of government. </p><p>Over the years, liberals have built a remarkable edifice of government programs that are justified by appeals to compassion: Head Start, immigration reform, gun control, affirmative action, and entitlements, to name only some. As Voegeli amply demonstrates, the liberals who promote these massive programs are weirdly indifferent as to whether they succeed. Instead, when the problems they are intended to solve fail to disappear, liberals double down, calling for yet more programs and ever greater expenditures in the name of "compassion." Meanwhile, conservatives who challenge the effectiveness of these programs are slandered as "heartless right-wingers." </p><p>Yet rather than challenge this tendentious liberal argument, the many conservatives it intimidates feel it necessary to insist that they really do "care." However, liberal compassion's good intentions consistently fail to translate into good results. Voegeli walks the reader through a plethora of programs that have become battlefields between conservatives fighting for more efficiency and liberals fighting for more budget-busting federal programs to address an ever-expanding catalog of social ills. Along the way, he explains the underpinnings of the liberal philosophy that reinforce this misapplied ideal and shows why today's self-described compassionate liberals are ultimately unfit to govern.</p><p>William Voegeli is the author of <em>Never Enough: America's Limitless Welfare State</em>, a visiting scholar at the Henry Salvatori Center at Claremont McKenna College, and a senior editor of <em>The Claremont Review of Books</em>.

Dainin Katagiri Roshi, one of the greatest pioneers of Zen in America, said this frequently, teasing Dosho Port and his fellow students. For Dosho, Katagiri Roshi's "haunting" still includes, to borrow a phrase from Warren Zevon, "keeping him in my heart a while" - continuing the intimate exploration of the indelible imprint that a Zen teacher leaves on a student's heart.<br> <br>Katagiri's teaching was at once powerful, gentle, and sometimes almost even casual. For Dosho, some of the richest teachings came in these simple, casual moments during everyday interactions. The structure of this book is built around a series of such vivid truth-happening places, evocative of the ancient koans of the Zen tradition, touching on such topics as the nature and purpose of Zen, the dynamic and working of realization, and, of course, the functioning of the teacher-student relationship.</p><p>Dosho Port is a Zen priest and Dharma heir of Dainin Katagiri in the Soto Zen tradition. He has also trained with Tangen Harada, Thich Nhat Hanh, and John Daido Loori. Dosho teaches with Wild Fox Zen at Transforming Through Play Temple in White Bear, Minnesota. He is a half-time single parent of two wonderful children and the program lead in a school for adolescents with severe behavior problems."Dosho weaves together the biography of his teacher with his own life as his student in a way that perfectly illustrates how Zen is transmitted through the generations, mind to mind, across all the seemingly insurmountable barriers of time and cultural difference." Author: Barry Magid, author of Ending the Pursuit of Happiness and Nothing Is Hidden<br><br>"The author generously sprinkles personal stories and Zen lore throughout this insightful book, laughing-sometimes through tears-at the perils and joys encountered by those who persevere along this ancient path. An insightful book." Author: Bodhin Kjolhede, Abbot of the Rochester Zen Center<br><br>"A wonderful book--I highly recommend it." Author: Nonin Chowaney, Abbot of the Nebraska Zen Center<br><br>"As Dogen Zenji said, Dharma teachers and disciples are like entwining of vines (katto in Japanese). Whether disciples are in the stage of faithfully following the teacher's style of teaching and practice, of rebelliously trying to become independent from the teacher, or of being mature enough for going beyond, the teacher's dharma always deeply penetrates the disciple. In this book Dosho Port offers one of the examples of continuation of Dharma from teacher to disciple, from the East to the West." Author: Shohaku Okumura<br><br>"This is a lovely, lovely book that can be read fruitfully by both beginners and those who are deeply familiar with the Zen way.

Movie tie-in.</p><p>The Disney animation juggernaut has high hopes that <i>Pocahontas</i> will equal or surpass in revenues last year's blockbuster, <i>The Lion King</i>. Whether it does or not, plenty of kids and adults will line up to see its romanticized, revisionist, politically correct take on the historical legend of the Indian princess Pocahontas and Capt. John Smith, and many will then want to look behind the scenes with this handsome coffee-table presentation that features 400 color and black-and-white illustrations, ranging from early conceptual drawings to production stills, and commentary by the movie's creators. The book downplays the film's message of multicultural harmony and its ecological import, instead stressing its compelling character designs, lavish backgrounds, and bold color schemes. Libraries in which the art book accompaniments for other recent Disney animated features have proved popular should add this one, too. <i>Gordon Flagg</i></p><h2>The Happiness of Getting It Down Right: Letters of Frank O&#39;Connor and William Maxwell, 1945-1966</h2><p>With 8 pages of photographs</p><p>of photographsCharming correspondence between the Irish short-story writer and his editor at the New Yorker. Over the course of their working relationship, O'Connor (190366) and Maxwell (born 1908) became close friends, and the chronologically arranged text narrates the deepening of their relationship. ``Mr. O'Connor'' and ``Mr. Maxwell'' give way by 1955 to ``Frank'' and ``Bill,'' and in 1956 Maxwell makes the transition to ``Michael,'' the name by which intimates addressed the writer, whose real name was Michael O'Donovan. (Most of the very few letters from the 1940s and early 1950s included here were exchanged with Gus Lobrano, who preceded Maxwell as O'Connor's New Yorker editor). Textual queries reveal the New Yorker's famously exacting editing process; indeed, it's slightly chilling, when O'Connor submits two stories in 1965 after a long dry spell, to read in Maxwell's rejection the blunt comment that ``the characters do not have the breath of life in them.'' Since editor Steinman (English/Nassau Community College) does not provide plot synopses, the extremely specific editorial comments will primarily engage those who are very familiar with O'Connor's work. Much more accessible are the two men's warm accounts of family life. ``Saturday I built a tree house for the children, and was as pleased as if I had written something,'' Maxwell writes in 1965; O'Connor bemoans in 1958 the fact that babies are so common in Dublin that his ``glorious'' infant daughter ``can be paraded through all the principal streets without anyone saying as much as `What a pretty child!' '' Also appealing are the correspondents' unabashed expressions of affection: ``I want Bill Maxwell,'' O'Connor reports ``wailing'' to his wife in one letter, while Maxwell signs off in another as ``Your friend who loves you.'' Most readers will pick up this volume for its literary interest, but the human content is what makes it memorable. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Anderson's dazzling debut presents the haunting story of a world where something has gone horribly awry . . .<br><br>Having escaped from Australia's Adelaide Zoo, an orphaned platypus named Albert embarks on a journey through the outback in search of "Old Australia," a rumored land of liberty, promise, and peace. What he will find there, however, away from the safe confinement of his enclosure for the first time since his earliest memories, proves to be a good deal more than he anticipated.<br><br>Alone in the outback, with an empty soft drink bottle as his sole possession, Albert stumbles upon pyromaniacal wombat Jack, and together they spend a night drinking and gambling in Ponsby Station, a rough-and-tumble mining town. Accused of burning down the local mercantile, the duo flees into menacing dingo territory and quickly go their separate ways-Albert to pursue his destiny in the wastelands, Jack to reconcile his past.<br>Encountering a motley assortment of characters along the way-a pair of invariably drunk bandicoots, a militia of kangaroos, hordes of the mercurial dingoes, and a former prize-fighting Tasmanian devil-our unlikely hero will discover a strength and skill for survival he never suspected he possessed.<br><br>Told with equal parts wit and compassion, ALBERT OF ADELAIDE shows how it is often the unexpected route, and the most improbable companions, that lead us on the path to who we really are. Who you journey with, after all, is far more important than wherever it is you are going.</p><p>Howard Anderson has had a varied life: He flew with a helicopter battalion in Vietnam, worked on fishing boats in Alaska, in the steel mills of Pittsburgh, as a truck driver in Houston, and a scriptwriter in Hollywood, and, after gaining a law degree,became legal counsel for the New Mexico Organized Crime Commission. He is currently a defense attorney in New Mexico, where he defends people from Mexico charged with crimes north of the border."If Larry McMurtry had written Wind in the Willows, he might have come up with something almost as wonderful and moving as Howard Anderson's Albert of Adelaide. This is a novel that defies analysis and summaries. Trust me. Just read it."&#x2015;<b><i>Mary Doria Russell, New York Times bestselling author of <i>The Sparrow </i>and <i>Doc</i></i></b><br><br>"This debut novel from a 69-year-old New Mexico lawyer is rich in commentary on weighty themes: power, fear, prejudice, and the fluid nature of good and evil. Most of all, Albert is a charming and compelling hero with the strength to honor his convictions while inventing a new life for himself. Readers who enjoy contemporary fiction with shades of social/political commentary will appreciate this."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Library Journal</i></i></b><br><br>"Memorable . . . lively . . . quick to satisfy with old-fashioned pleasures: action, adventure, fast friends, and unlikely heroes."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publishers Weekly</i></i></b><br><br>"Required reading....If you've been searching for an old-fashioned Western with a platypus protagonist, wait no more."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The New York Post</i></i></b><br><br>"Trust me.

In these delightful paintings Renoir creates uniquely endearing and enduring images of pleasure, comfort, and prosperity.</p><p>The pleasure Bailey obviously takes in setting out in detail the life stories of Renoir's subjects--we learn of Mlle. Legrand's two marriages, her children, her jobs, etc.--reveals him as a traditionalist who believes that facts count. The reader will find no signs of the current preoccupation with "theory" (and, blessedly, none of its jargon), and little in the way of psychological or social interpretation. Bailey assumes that the more we know about Renoir's sitters the more we will understand his pictures; but he often fails even to try to relate this information to any perception of Renoir's brushwork, color, and composition. In most entries, it is true, the attentive reader will find evocative and gracefully written descriptive passages.... -- <i>The New York Review of Books, Robert L. Herbert</i></p><h2>The King&#39;s Day: Louis XIV of France</h2><p>A day in the life of France&#39;s King Louis XIV, focusing on the elaborate ceremonies which took place when he dressed in the morning, ate his meals, conducted affairs of state, entertained, and finally, when he prepared to go to bed at night.</p><p>Grade 2-5-- As she did in A Medieval Feast (Crowell, 1983), Aliki draws upon prints and pictures from art history and incorporates facts about real people and places to introduce young people to a high period of Western history. In this case the "moment" she recreates is a day at the royal court of Versailles. Pictures of Louis XIV and his court are framed by a narrow gold border; many of the illustrations have inscriptions underneath in the manner of 17th-century engravings. The text, in bolder print, adds facts and explanations to the descriptive pictures. Color is the most striking element in Aliki's drawings. The richness of the king's costumes, his wigs, lace, red stockings, and high- heeled shoes are echoed by the attire of his courtiers. The pictures vary in size and placement, leading readers' eyes through the events of the king's day, from the royal rising ritual to the final ceremonial "coucher" or going-to-bed. The spectacular size of the palace of Versailles and the crowded events of court life, all centering on the elaborately costumed figure of Louis XIV, capture the spirit of absolute monarchy in a form that will surely appeal to curious children in this age of democracy and the common man. The book contains a brief chronology and a list of French words, but with no guide to pronunciation. Never mind--it is the pictures that tell the story. --Shirley Wilton, Ocean County College, Toms River, NJ<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Life at the court of Versailles boggles the mind: Louis XIV had, among other things, a garden containing four million tulips, and an everyday supper consisted of some 40 dishes! Tidbits like this abound in Aliki's new book, in which she chronicles a day in the life of this 17th-century monarch. Her thorough research never overwhelms the seamless telling, although some details won't suit every reader: an entire page is devoted to the monarch's mistresses and the many offspring they bore him. Some of the pages seem crowded; perhaps a more generous design, allowing for more white space, would have been more effective. Nevertheless, the book presents an intriguing glimpse of the splendor and extravagance of the Sun King's court.

Say hello to Bradley the Buyer, the best narcotics agent in the business. Attend international playboy A.J.&#39;s annual party, where the punch is to be treated with extreme caution. Meet Dr &#39;Fingers&#39; Schafer, the Lobotomy Kid and his giant centipede, &#39;The Complete American De-anxietized Man.&#39; And enter the dark and infernal mind of Bill Lee as he pursues his daily quest for the ultimate merchandise! Provocative, influential, morbidly fascinating, &#39;Naked Lunch&#39; is an apocalyptic ride through the darker recesses of the human psyche.</p><p>"He was," as <i>Salon</i>'s Gary Kamyia notes, "20th-century drug culture's Poe, its Artaud, its Baudelaire. He was the prophet of the literature of pure experience, a phenomenologist of dread.... Burroughs had the scary genius to turn the junk wasteland into a parallel universe, one as thoroughly and obsessively rendered as Blake's." <p> Why has this homosexual ex-junkie, whose claim to fame rests entirely on one book--the hallucinogenic ravings of a heroin addict--so seized the collective imagination? Burroughs wrote <i>Naked Lunch</i> in a Tangier, Morocco, hotel room between 1954 and 1957. Allen Ginsberg and his beatnik cronies burst onto the scene, rescued the manuscript from the food-encrusted floor, and introduced some order to the pages. It was published in Paris in 1959 by the notorious Olympia Press and in the U.S. in 1962; the landmark obscenity trial that ensued served to end literary censorship in America. </p><p> Burroughs's literary experiment--the much-touted "cut-up" technique--mirrored the workings of a junkie's brain. But it was junk coupled with vision: Burroughs makes teeming amalgam of allegory, sci-fi, and non-linear narration, all wrapped in a blend of humor--slapstick, Swiftian, slang-infested humor. What is <i>Naked Lunch</i> about? People turn into blobs amidst the sort of evil that R. Crumb, in the decades to come, would inimitably flesh out with his dark and creepy cartoon images. Perhaps the most easily grasped part of <i>Naked Lunch</i> is its America-bashing, replete with slang and vitriol. Read it and see for yourself.</p>William Burroughs was born in St Louis, Missouri, in 1914. Immensely influential among the Beat writers of the 1950s -- notably Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg -- he already had an underground reputation before the appearance of his first important book, &#39;Naked Lunch&#39;. Originally published by the daring and influential Olympia Press (the original publishers of Henry Miller) in France in 1959, it aroused great controversy on publication and was not available in the US until 1962 and in the UK until 1964. The book was adapted for film by David Cronenberg in 1991</p><h2>Chumash: The Gutnick Edition - All in one - Synagogue Edition</h2><p>The Torah, Bible of the Jews, has a fresh and powerful newcomer. Torah translations are guided by a variety of approaches, and a great deal of debate occurs over which most effectively communicates.

Rewald uses the documentary approach taken in his History of Impressionism (1961) to describe the life and work of Cezanne. The artist's character is revealed in his own words and in those of his friends, especially the novelist Emile Zola, making Cezanne accessible in a way simple narrative cannot. Adding greatly to our understanding of Cezanne's development as a painter are the 270 illustrations, many of unfamiliar works here published in color for the first time. The fact that the work was originally published 50 years ago as Rewald's doctoral thesis does not diminish its value, as the author has revised and expanded it and updated the bibliography.

For that matter, why does so much scientific literature compare poorly with, say, the phone book? After struggling with questions like these for years, biologist Richard Dawkins has taken a wide-ranging view of the subjects of meaning and beauty in <i>Unweaving the Rainbow</i>, a deeply humanistic examination of science, mysticism, and human nature. Notably strong-willed in a profession of bet-hedgers and wait-and-seers, Dawkins carries the reader along on a romp through the natural and cultural worlds, determined that "science, at its best, should leave room for poetry."<p> Inspired by the frequently asked question, "Why do you bother getting up in the morning?" following publication of his book <i>The Selfish Gene</i>, Dawkins set out determined to show that understanding nature's mechanics need not sap one's zest for life. Alternately enlightening and maddening, <i>Unweaving the Rainbow</i> will appeal to all thoughtful readers, whether wild-eyed technophiles or grumpy, cabin-dwelling Luddites. Excoriations of newspaper astrology columns follow quotes from Blake and Shakespeare, which are sandwiched between sparkling, easy-to-follow discussions of probability, behavior, and evolution. In Dawkins's world (and, he hopes, in ours), science <i>is</i> poetry; he ends his journey by referring to his title's author and subject, maintaining that "A Keats and a Newton, listening to each other, might hear the galaxies sing." <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>In 1995 Richard Dawkins became the first holder of the Charles Simonyi Chair of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University. He is the bestselling author of THE SELFISH GENE, THE BLIND WATCHMAKER (Penguin, 1988) and CLIMBING MOUNT IMPROBABLE (Penguin, 1996).</p><h2>The Fly and the Fish</h2><p>An internationally renowned artist, John Atherton was also a legend in the world of fly fishing.&nbsp;This lost classic, originally published in 1951, combines evocative reminiscences of Vermont fishing expeditions with practical directions for fly-tying. Exquisite sketches of tools and fishing scenes complement the text. 105 illustrations.<br></p><p>John Atherton first gained fame after moving from San Francisco to New York City to stake his claim as a commercial artist. Encouraged by a fellow artist, Atherton eventually moved away from the commercial art scene and became immersed in the realist approach to painting landscapes. Atherton would go on to win several prestigious awards during the Second World War for his patriotic artwork, at which point he went on to create covers for numerous publications, most notably "The Saturday Evening Post." Along with his many works of art, Atherton became famous among the fly-fishing community for his beautiful fly patterns. He lived in Arlington, Vermont.<br></p><h2>Gallows Thief</h2><p><p><em>A spellbinding historical drama about an ex-soldier in 1820s London who must help rescue an innocent man from Death Row, by bestselling author Bernard Cornwell</em></p><p>It is the end of the Napoleonic Wars and England has just fought its last victorious battle against the French. As Rider Sandman and the other heroes of Waterloo begin to make their way back to England, they find a country where corruption, poverty, and social unrest run rampant, and where "justice" is most often delivered at the end of a hangman's noose. Nowhere in London are the streets as busy as in front of Newgate Prison, its largest penitentiary, where mobs gather regularly to watch the terrible spectacle of the doomed men and women on the gallows' stands.</p><p>Rider Sandman -- whose reputation on the battlefields of France is exceeded only by his renown on the cricket fields of England -- returns home from war to discover his personal affairs in a shambles. Creditors have taken over his estate, leaving him penniless -- and forcing him to release the woman he loves from her obligations to marry him. Desperate to right his situation, he accepts the offer of a job investigating the claims of innocence by a painter due to hang for murder in a few days' time. The Home Secretary makes it clear that this is pro-forma, and that he expects Sandman to rubber-stamp the verdict.But Sandman's investigation reveals that something is amiss -- that there is merit to the young artist's claims. He further discovers that, though the Queen herself has ordered a reinvestigation of the circumstances, someone else does not want the truth revealed.</p><p>In a race against the clock, Sandman moves from the hellish bowels of Newgate prison to the perfumed drawing rooms of the aristocracy, determined to rescue the innocent man from the rope. As he begins to peel back the layers of an utterly corrupt penal system, he finds himself pitted against some of the wealthiest and most ruthless men in Regency England.</p><p><em>Gallows Thief</em> combines the rich historical texture of Edward Rutherford and the taut suspense of Caleb Carr to create an eviscerating portrait of capital punishment in nineteeth-century London.</p></p><p><p>BERNARD CORNWELL is the author of the acclaimed <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Saxon Tales series, which includes <em>The Last Kingdom, The Pale Horseman, Lords of the North, Sword Song, The Burning Land, Death of Kings, The Pagan Lord</em>, and, most recently, <em>The Empty Throne </em>and <em>Warriors of the Storm</em>, and which serves as the basis for the hit television series <em>The Last Kingdom</em>. He lives with his wife on Cape Cod and in Charleston, South Carolina. </p>Rider Sandman, the government's investigator, believes a painter due to hang in a week is innocent of murder. His investigation sparks a race for proof that will last until the hour of execution. James Frain reads with a somber tone that adds tension and menace to Sandman's quest. His readings of the hanging scenes that open and close the novel are harrowing, as are details emphasizing the cruelty of English prisons of the post-Napoleonic era in general and the gallows in particular. The abridgment is effective, preserving both historical details and the murder plot. The novel works both as a thriller and as a glimpse of life in England shortly after the French Wars.

He has received Brazil&#39;s highest awards for poetry multiple times: the Jabuti Prize in both 1990 and 2002, the Nestle Poetry Prize in 1997 and 2006, and the Ministry of Culture&#39;s Cecilia Meireles Prize in 1998. His unusual life and work were the subject of Joel Pizzini&#39;s 1989 film O Caramujo Flor. Idra Novey&#39;s first collection of poems, The Next Country, was published in 2008. A book of her translations of poet Paulo Henriques Britto, The Clean Shirt of It, received a PEN Translation Fund Award and was published in 2007. She teaches in the School of the Arts at Columbia University, where she is the director of Columbia&#39;s Center for Literary Translation.The marshy, rural wetlands of western Brazil have been de Barros's stomping grounds throughout his more than nine&#x2013;decade life, and they constitute the presiding spirit of this collection of poems from 1960 to 2009, selected and translated by Novey. The poems are powered by strange transformations that seem natural, inevitable. De Barros's is a world in which speakers "exhibit the traits of the fruit fly," or "have a doctorate in ants," or in which "an old man plays his flute/ to invert the sunsets" and "cigarettes, out of love, get lost in the trees." The act of writing is seamlessly integrated into the physicality, eroticism, and magic of his surreal and decadent ecosystem. Comparing the poet "in a coitus with letters" to the slug who "screws the stone," he continues: "A poet is a creature who licks words and gets delirious." Still, de Barros isn't a romanticizer: pain, poverty, and "grounds besieged by abandon" make their necessary appearance. In the end, his ambition seems to be to give voice to the intimacies of his particular, meticulously studied world: "To be like things that have no mouth!/ Communication by infusion/ by rite/ by incrustation.... To be creatures, children,/ dry leaves." (Dec.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

The Chronicles follow the intrigues of ambition and love in the cathedral town of Barchester. Trollope was of course interested in the Church, that pillar of Victorian society - in its susceptibility to corruption, hypocrisy, and blinkered conservatism - but the Barsetshire novels are no more `ecclesiastical' than his Palliser novels are `political'. It is the behavior of the individuals within a power structure that interests him. In this novel Trollope continues the story of Mr. Harding and his daughter Eleanor, adding to his cast of characters that oily symbol of progress Mr. Slope, the hen-pecked Dr. Proudie, and the amiable and breezy Stanhope family. The central questions of this moral comedy - Who will be warden? Who will be dean? Who will marry Eleanor? - are skillfully handled with that subtlety of ironic observation that has won Trollope such a wide and appreciative readership.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

The magical day ends when Charlie is given the factory and goes in the Great Glass Elevator to collect his family and to take them to their new home.</p><p><i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i> and its sequel, <i>Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator</i>, along with Roald Dahl's other tales for younger readers, make him a true star of children's literature. Dahl seems to know just how far to go with his oddball fantasies; in <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,</i> for example, nasty Violet Beauregarde blows up into a blueberry from sneaking forbidden chewing gum, and bratty Augustus Gloop is carried away on the river of chocolate he wouldn't resist. In fact, all manner of disasters can happen to the most obnoxiously deserving of children because Dahl portrays each incident with such resourcefulness and humor. <p> <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i> is a singular delight, crammed with mad fantasy, childhood justice and revenge, and as much candy as you can eat. The book is also available in Spanish (<i>Charlie y la Fabrica de Chocolate</i>). (The suggested age range for this book is 9-12, but nobody this reviewer has met can resist it, including New York City bellhops, flight attendants, and grumpy teenagers.)</p>What happens when the five luckiest children in the entire world walk through the doors of Willy Wonka&#39;s famous, mysterious chocolate factory? What happens when, one by one, the children disobey Mr. Wonka&#39;s orders? In Dahl&#39;s most popular story, the nasty are punished and the good are deliciously, sumptuously rewarded.</p><h2>Ark</h2><p>With the discovery of another life-sustaining planet light years away, there is hope for a chosen few to leave the soon-to-be submerged Earth. Holle Groundwater is one of the candidates, having been trained for this purpose since childhood, when the ships <i>Ark One</i> and <i>Ark Three</i> were being built. But as Holle prepares to endure life aboard the Ark, she comes to realize that her attempt at escape may be more dangerous than trying to stay afloat on a drowning planet...</p><p><b>Stephen Baxter</b> was born in Liverpool, England, in 1957. He holds degrees in mathematics, from Cambridge University; engineering, from Southampton University; and business administration, from Henley Management College. He&#x2019;s a Chartered Engineer and Fellow of the British Interplanetary Society.<p>His first professionally published short story appeared in 1987. He has been a full-time author since 1995 and is currently Vice-President of the British Science Fiction Association.</p><p>His science fiction novels have been published in the UK, the US, and in many other countries including Germany, Japan, France. His books have won several awards including the Philip K Dick Award, the John Campbell Memorial Award, the British Science Fiction Association Award, the Kurd Lasswitz Award (Germany) and the Seiun Award (Japan) and have been nominated for several others, including the Arthur C Clarke Award, the Hugo Award and Locus awards. He has also published over 100 sf short stories, several of which have won prizes. He can be found at stephen-baxter.com.</p>Baxter's riveting follow-up to bestseller Flood tempers the hope of humanity coming together in the face of a crisis with an often brutal undercurrent of realism, resulting in a sequel that surpasses the original in almost every way. Set during the later years of the earth-destroying flood, the book follows Holle Groundwater and her friends as they go from being six-year-old students of an experimental space academy to a years-long trip through the cosmos in search of Earth 2. The best-laid plans are often, and unexpectedly, disrupted at almost every stage; the ship must deal with stowaways, unqualified applicants, infighting, and even mutiny. Characteristic of Baxter's writing, the novel can be depressing at times but still serves as a study of humanity's ability to adapt and make painful decisions for the greater good. With an almost completely new cast, readers old and new will be engaged by the strength and scope of Baxter's vision, and the all-too-human characters he creates. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A drug that made you focused, charming, fast, even attractive. Eddie Spinola is on such a drug. It's called MDT-48, and it's Viagra for the brain-a designer drug that's redesigning his life. But while MDT is helping Eddie achieve the kind of success he's only dreamed about, it's also chipping away at his sanity-splitting headaches, spontaneous blackouts, violent outbursts. And now that he's hooked and his supply is running low, Eddie must venture into the drug's dark past to feed his habit. What he discovers proves that MDT, once a dream come true, has become his worst nightmare. <br><br></p><p><br><b>Alan Glynn</b> lived in New York for four years. He now lives and works in Dublin. This is his first novel. <br><br>Bordering on techno-thriller territory, this slick, suspenseful debut imagines a new breed of "smart drug" that produces some deadly side effects. After complaining about life in desperate times to his drug dealer/ex-brother-in-law Vernon, divorced Manhattan copywriter Eddie Spinola is tempted by the glittering promise of MDT-48, an illegal, nearly unknown designer medication guaranteed to spike intelligence and personality in mere minutes. It really works, but Eddie's initial rush is so mind-blowing that even discovering Vernon's murdered body (and a hidden stash of cash and pills) barely interrupts his growing addiction. He chooses to ignore the mounting side effects of MDT-48: piercing headaches, intense bouts of rage and "trip-switching," a phenomenon in which time moves with a stop-motion quality. Day trading on the stock market like a seasoned professional, Eddie soon becomes an immensely wealthy junkie armed with awe-inspiring artistic and financial brainpower. But when he's implicated in the brutal murder of a high-profile artist's wife and also linked to pharmaceutical espionage, his perfect new world unravels and the shocking truth about MDT-48's origin and purpose is revealed. Glynn's sustained, rapid-fire pace hurls readers headfirst toward a gripping, if bleak, conclusion that makes for some breathless page-turning. Dublin-based Glynn, who lived in New York for four years, gets the frenzied pace of the city just right. And though Eddie's demise is foreshadowed from the opening paragraph, his likability as a protagonist serves the swift and thrilling narrative well. Fine secondary characters like shady Russian loan shark Gennady and Eddie's ex-wife Melissa appear in many scenes, but the reader remains riveted to Eddie's fate in this impeccably imagined and executed debut. (Jan.) Forecast: Young, hip readers who are open to experimentation will be the first audience for this credible and timely thriller. Word of mouth will do the rest. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Innovative Saltwater Flies</h2><p>*90 color photos<br> * 8 x 11<br> * Patterns and recipes for 271 flies from 37 top innovators<br> * Profiles and photos of the tiers<br> * Flies for Atlantic and Pacific coasts, Mexico, the Caribbean<br> <p>"An excellent addition to historical documentation of the sport."--Kathleen Achor, editor of <i>The American Fly Fisher</i> </p><p>On Michael Radencich's color plates of flies:<br> "I'm out of superlatives for his work."--Christopher Camuto, <i>Gray's Sporting Journal</i>, February 1998 </p><p>This sumptuously illustrated reference is organized by tier, with background information on each expert's saltwater fishing experience and the development of his or her favorite patterns.

Published in 1880, this short fantasy takes us to a completely flat world of two physical dimensions where all the inhabitants are geometric shapes, and who think the planar world of length and width that they know is all there is. But one inhabitant discovers the existence of a third physical dimension, enabling him to finally grasp the concept of a fourth dimension. Watching our Flatland narrator, we begin to get an idea of the limitations of our own assumptions about reality, and we start to learn how to think about the confusing problem of higher dimensions. The book is also quite a funny satire on society and class distinctions of Victorian England.<p> <em>Flatland</em> (1884) is an influential mathematical fantasy that simultaneously provides an introduction to non-Euclidean geometry and a satire on the Victorian class structure, issues of science and faith, and the role of women. A classic of early science fiction, the novel takes place in a world of two dimensions where all the characters are geometric shapes. The narrator, A Square, is a na�ve, respectable citizen who is faced with proof of the existence of three dimensions when he is visited by a sphere and is forced to see the limitations of his world. </p> <p> The introduction to this Broadview Edition provides context for the book&#x2019;s references to Victorian culture and religion, mathematical history, and the history of philosophy. The appendices contain contemporary reviews; extracts from the work of fellow mathematical fantasy writer/mathematician Charles Hinton; Hermann von Helmboltz&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Axioms of Geometry&#x201d; (1870); and autobiographical passages from Abbott&#x2019;s <em>The Kernel and the Husk</em> (1886). </p></p><h2>Eric Kincaid&#39;s Mother Goose Classic Nursery Rhymes</h2><p>A volume of nursery rhymes that will delight children through the ages enhanced by beautiful and delightful illustrations</p><p></p><h2>Freedom through Love: The Search for Meaning in Life: Rudolf Steiner&#39;s &#34;Philosophy of Freedom&#34;</h2><p>What does it mean to be human? What is knowledge? What is freedom? Philosophy offers answers to these questions. However, are its rarefied arguments relevant to people today or merely abstractions? Aren&#x2019;t we really more occupied with daily survival and the unending problems that surround our human relationships?<br><br>Nonetheless, most if not everyone looks for meaning in life. It is less than satisfying to think of ourselves as specks on a random planet in a solar system and part of a vast, clockwork universe. To dismiss consciousness as meaningless or merely a play of chance is to give up our efforts to find any true meaning in existence.<br><br><i>Freedom through Love</i> offers possibilities for dealing with some of these big questions and leads us to satisfying and convincing conclusions. Although based on Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s &#x201c;Philosophy of Freedom,&#x201d; Nick Thomas does not begin his book with complex philosophical arguments, but with themes that reflect the modern time. &#x201c;Let us not start with abstract questions far from life, but from life itself,&#x201d; he suggests in his opening page. Thus, the search for meaning, truth, freedom, and love begins with the realities of our daily life&#x2015;people and human relationships, which constitute the most difficult, though real, issues of contemporary society and life.</p><p><b>Nick C.

He trained as an electrical engineer in the Royal Air Force, serving as an engineering officer for sixteen years and, subsequently, worked in data communications for Nortel. With Lawrence Edwards and John Wilkes he researched the practical application of projective geometry. His major research interest is the development and application of Steiner's discovery of negative space to building a bridge between natural and spiritual science. He lectures widely on this and on other anthroposophic subjects.</p><h2>With Unveiled Faces: Experience Intimacy with God Through Spiritual Disciplines</h2><p>Spiritual disciplines are those things we do--or don&#39;t do--that bring us closer to God. They are habitual actions and responses that form us spiritually. Master teacher Keith Drury leads the way to a vibrant relationship with god through classic spiritual disciplines. Augmenting long-established Christian practices with mocern research, Drury offers a smorgasbord of approaches for developing intimacy with God.

Wendland follows a &#34;discourse analysis&#34; approach-examining different aspects of the poetic texts as an integrated whole. His primary focus is upon the formal features of the psalms, but elements of content (key terms) and function (psalm types or genres) also receive due consideration.

He is the author of numerous studies on the Bantu languages of South Central Africa, biblical exegesis, and translation theory.</p><p>Dr. Wendland teaches at the Lutheran Bible Institute and Seminary in Lusaka, Zambia, and is a United Bible Societies Translation Consultant.

The overall theme is loss, both the social loss from the disappearance of communities due to the external effects of technology, and the personal loss from the death of a family member. The book is divided into five sections with the first and last dealing with the social impacts of the flooding of the Jocassee Valley on the border of North and South Carolina. <p>As in his other books, Rash is very precise in his use of language, with the prosody being informed by Welsh forms. Many of the poems use a style of syllabic verse featuring seven- syllable lines with internal echos, but most readers will not notice the craftsmanship of these poems because they flow so naturally. There is great narrative intensity in these poems with short poems of short lines telling detailed and vivid stories.</p></p><p>Ron Rash grew up in Boiling Springs, North Carolina. He graduated from Gardner-Webb College and Clemson University. He now lives in Clemson, South Carolina, with his wife and two children. He teaches English at Tri-County Technical College, and he teaches poetry in the M.F.A. program at Queens College in Charlotte, North Carolina. <p>In 1987 his fiction won a General Electric Younger Writers Award, and in 1994 he was awarded an NEA Poetry Fellowship.

Yet underneath his hallowed image seethed an unfaithful husband who spoke of desire to see his wife killed. So when Carol Neulander was found bludgeoned to death in the living room of the couple's Cherry Hill home, authorities immediately suspected that the beloved spiritual leader was involved. But without any evidence the case began to stagnate. The complex web of secrets, lies, and murder was only just beginning...<br><br>Six years after the killing, private eye Leonard Jenoff came forward with the shocking confession that blew the case wide open: Rabbi Neulander was hired Jenoff and Paul Daniels to kill his wife. Incredibly, Jenoff thought he had been hired to kill an anti-Jewish terrorist. Daniels blamed schizophrenia for his involvement. Neulander insisted he was innocent, setting the stage for a sensational trial that would leave a wealthy community shattered and expose a much darker side to this charming man of God.<br></p><p><br> <b>ERIC FRANCIS</b> is a freelance reporter and photojournalist whose work has appeared in dozens of newspapers and magazines in over 30 countries. A staff correspondent for <i>People</i> magazine, Francis has also covered several notable murder cases for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Boston Globe</i>, and <i>Time</i> magazine. He lives on the Vermont-New Hampshire border and was one of the first reporters on the scene of the Zantop double homicide in January, 2001.CHAPTER ONECAROL Neulander was an extremely busy person. If someone wanted to kill her, they&#x2019;d have to find her first.Carol was the mother of three children aged 18 to 24, and the wife of Fred Neulander, the founder and senior rabbi of Congregation M&#x2019;kor Shalom in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which made her the &#x201c;First Lady&#x201d; of the more than nine hundred families that comprised the M&#x2019;kor Shalom synagogue&#x2019;s &#x201c;family of families.&#x201d;Carol Neulander was also a successful businesswoman. She had begun a bakery right out of her home oven, and expanded it over the course of a decade to the point where, by the fall of 1994, it was a full-fledged bakery chain with two growing retail stores in the neighboring New Jersey towns of Audubon and Voorhees.Even at age 52, with her career and social life well established, Carol&#x2019;s day-to-day comings and goings hadn&#x2019;t slowed down. Her schedule was a whirl of appointments and meetings, activities and gatherings. Business and personal trips took her constantly around Cherry Hill and to the surrounding suburban and rural New Jersey townships. She also ranged frequently into the city of Philadelphia nearby and farther on up the Atlantic coast to New York City.Carol&#x2019;s close friends regarded keeping up with her as a challenge, but if they left a message on her answering machine they would soon hear back, perhaps as she took a few minutes to call from one of her bakery&#x2019;s locations. Often she would call from the car phone in her dark Toyota Camry as she drove from one appointment to the next.Standing just over five feet tall, the 136-pound Carol was never an imposing woman, but she had a straightforward take-charge manner and she made her presence felt wherever she went. Her inherent decisiveness was tempered by a kindness and warmth that seemed to radiate from her. With well-groomed auburn hair, expensive but tasteful jewelry, and large, dark eyes, she seemed to fill up the space around her. Carol was energetic and striking and had her own complex life that consumed most of her waking hours, but she liked to take the time to understand and interact with the people she was dealing with throughout her day. It was this genuinely caring nature of hers that had endeared her to so many people over the years, and it was a characteristic which many people felt she shared with her husband Fred.As a couple, Carol and Fred Neulander were a matched set and a walking contrast at the same time. Not much taller than Carol at five-foot-four, Rabbi Fred Neulander was a solid wall of muscle in a suit jacket, or on some days just a dress shirt and bow tie. Fred was as sharp and as charismatic as any successful politician, and could be just as arrogant and irritating. He was undeniably dynamic, he oozed self-confidence, and he had a reputation for bringing people together and making sure things got done. Now, at age 54, he was the living embodiment of the community of M&#x2019;kor Shalom, which he had created by sheer force of will. It was a community that had revolved around him for over two decades, during which he had played a pivotal role in almost all of the major milestones and events in the combined lives of thousands of people. To many of the congregants for whom he had spent a lifetime being God&#x2019;s messenger, Fred Neulander was the next best thing to the Boss upstairs.M&#x2019;kor Shalom, which in Hebrew means &#x201c;Source of Peace,&#x201d; was itself a monument to Fred&#x2019;s electrifying effect on other people. It had rapidly grown to become the largest Reform Jewish synagogue in southern New Jersey, but Neulander had founded it on nothing more than a vision when, in 1974, as a young assistant rabbi at Temple Emanuel, Fred led what was in effect a palace <i>coup d&#x2019; etat.</i>Standing in the front room of a friend&#x2019;s home, the young Rabbi Neulander had gathered together a small handful of potential defectors and spoken forcefully about what he thought a progressive synagogue should be like, and how he would do things differently if he were in charge. It was his own mix of Reform Judiasm&#x2014;a blend of traditions that he felt needed to be adhered to in order to keep true to Jewish spiritual and cultural identity, but at the same time, a profound willingness to experiment and to add the best elements of modern secular culture to the worship services and, more importantly, to the day-in, day-out life of the synagogue. He wanted M&#x2019;kor Shalom to be a community, not where people escaped from daily life to visit the traditions of their dead ancestors, but a living place where they carried on their lives in conjunction with their friends and their faith.Captivated by Fred&#x2019;s heartfelt message, the handful of couples who were present agreed on the spot to put up the money for the new venture. Eighteen families initially followed Rabbi Neulander out of Temple Emanuel and began M&#x2019;kor Shalom more as an ideal than as an institution. The first services were held in a house borrowed from a real estate agent; the High Holy Days were celebrated at the Holiday Inn. Eventually a small warehouse in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, was divided into a sanctuary for the congregation and a Hebrew school for the children. It was an experiment operating on a shoestring and held together by Fred Neulander&#x2019;s forceful personality, but it had an undeniable warmth and a strong core of faith&#x2014;and soon it had a waiting list to join.In the early years of the new synagogue, Fred Neulander was a blur of activity: officiating at weekly Sabbath services, presiding over bat and bar mitzvahs, visiting the sick, manning the phones at the crisis hotline he&#x2019;d helped create, teaching adult classes in Hebrew and the Torah. By his side throughout was Carol, caring and gracious where Fred was inspiring and gregarious.Just as M&#x2019;kor Shalom was a blend of different aspects of traditional and modern Judaism, the Neulanders themselves were a blend of Old World and New World backgrounds.Carol had been born Carol Toby Lidz, the daughter of a wealthy button manufacturer in New York City&#x2019;s fabled Garment District. She had grown up on a sweeping estate in Hewlett Harbor, Long Island, with her sister and two brothers, where they were served by a butler and doted over by a governess.Carol&#x2019;s upbringing on the manicured ocean-side lawns of coastal New York stood in sharp contrast with the early years of Fred Jay Neulander, who grew up in a rough-and-tumble section of Albany.Neulander&#x2019;s immigrant parents owned a dry-cleaning business that his father struggled to run while his wife stayed home and cared for Fred, their only child. The Neulanders&#x2019; surroundings were humble, but they had a profound love of learning and literature, both of which they instilled in Fred at an early age. They also took great pride in the fact that six successive generations of the Neulander family had produced rabbis, the most recent being Fred&#x2019;s uncle.Fred Neulander and Carol Lidz&#x2019;s very different worlds would collide on a blind date in 1963. Fred was a senior at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. He was studying religion and philosophy in a sophisticated environment that was new to him, but which he nonetheless adapted to wholeheartedly. Carol was a junior at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, where she was studying psychology. It was an era when girlfriends wore their boyfriends&#x2019; college pins, and soon Carol was &#x201c;pinned&#x201d; to Fred. An engagement followed and they were married right after their graduations in 1965.It was a standing family joke that the prospect of having Fred, who could manage to look either like a distinguished businessman or a truck driver, depending on how he was dressed, as a son-in-law had terrified his future in-laws. Carol would slyly tell the story of how her father had turned to her as she stood in her wedding dress&#x2014;just moments from walking down the aisle&#x2014;and whispered hopefully to her, &#x201c;I can still get you out of this.&#x201d;At first the newly married couple stayed in New York, moving to Queens, where Fred earned a degree in Hebrew literature and was ordained as a rabbi in 1968 at the Hebrew Union College Jewish Institute of Religion. It was his pursuit of a graduate degree at Dropsie University that moved the couple to the Philadelphia area. Three years after their marriage, Fred had found the position as an assistant rabbi at Temple Emanuel in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and he and Carol had moved to an apartment in that expanding suburban township.In 1975, the year after Fred defected and began M&#x2019;kor Shalom, the Neulanders purchased a modest but nice two-story Colonial house on a quiet side street in the Wexford Leas section of Cherry Hill, and began raising a family.Cherry Hill, and most of western New Jersey, had once been rolling farmland punctuated by woods. But over the years it had become increasingly bisected by artery roads taking advantage of the growing suburban sprawl. The new grid of paved roads brought a cycle of boom development that in turn required even more roads until, by the time the Millennium hit, it seemed like every franchise that had ever advertised in North America finally stretched cheek-by-jowl down the length of Route 70.In the 1960s, residential developers swept through Cherry Hill and built hundreds of houses practically arm&#x2019;s-length apart on winding little roads and cul-desacs that were carved out of the remaining farm fields with all possible expediency. Sprinkling in as many Colonial and Federal architectural details as they could think of along the way, the home designers tried to keep some reference to the history-steeped neighborhoods of Philadelphia, located just a few miles to the west, where the nation had been born. Then they tried to make up the difference by giving the tangle of brand new streets a series of particularly unlikely but historic-sounding names. These ranged from the merely improbable (&#x201c;Gatehouse Lane&#x201d; and &#x201c;Candlewyck Way&#x201d;) to the overly imaginative (&#x201c;Society Hill Boulevard&#x201d; and &#x201c;Buckingham Place&#x201d;).With his own reputation as a charismatic spiritual and cultural leader well established, and his congregation steadily growing and prospering, it soon was time for Fred Neulander to lead M&#x2019;kor Shalom to a more permanent location. In 1991 Rabbi Neulander guided the synagogue&#x2019;s swelling membership out of the converted warehouse to a piece of land on the Evesham Road in southeastern Cherry Hill, only a few miles from his own house.The new complex of cream-colored buildings with their orange standing-seam metal peaked roofs sat beside one of the region&#x2019;s artery roads. The collection of buildings was a testament to how firmly the community had taken root during the two decades Fred Neulander had been at the helm. It was the eighth synagogue to be established within Cherry Hill, where a third of the 70,000 residents are Jewish, but it was now also the largest.At its heart, any religious congregation is a reflection of, and is in fact all about, the families that make it up. By 1994, when it was said that M&#x2019;kor Shalom had over 4,000 members, what they really meant was that 930 families considered it the hub of their spiritual and social life.For so many of those who belonged to M&#x2019;kor Shalom, Carol, as the wife of the beloved senior rabbi, was practically a member of their own extended families. The congregation greeted her with affection and admiration when she walked through the hallways. They enjoyed her insights and her sharp sense of humor. They shared stories about their own lives and their families with her.Each Friday evening as worship services were about to begin, the congregation took note as Carol entered and sat in her accustomed place near the front of the sanctuary. But within the peaceful walls of M&#x2019;kor Shalom, amongst the hundreds of congregants who watched Carol Neulander&#x2019;s comings and goings, there was at least one person who was planning to murder her.Copyright � 2002 by Eric Francis.</p><h2>The Demeter Cookbook: Recipes Based on Biodynamic Ingredients</h2><p>This &#x201c;official&#x201d; <i>Demeter Cookbook</i> presents more than 200 recipes developed and collected by the Swiss Chef Hermann Spindler.

Ch�gyam Trungpa Rinpoche shows that meditation extends beyond the formal practice of sitting to build the foundation for compassion, awareness, and creativity in all aspects of life. Trungpa describes the life of the Buddha and emphasizes that, like the Buddha, we must find the truth for ourselves, rather than following someone else's example. Meditation in action might also be called "working meditation," for it is not a retreat from the world. Rather, it builds the foundation for tremendous compassion, awareness, and creativity in all aspects of a person's mind or behavior.<br><br>He explores the six activities associated with meditation in action--generosity, discipline, patience, energy, clarity, and wisdom--revealing that through simple, direct experience, one can attain real wisdom: the ability to see clearly into situations and deal with them skillfully, without the self-consciousness connected with ego.</p><p>Ch�gyam Trungpa (1940&#x2013;1987)&#x2014;meditation master, teacher, and artist&#x2014;founded Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, the first Buddhist-inspired university in North America; the Shambhala Training program; and an international association of meditation centers known as Shambhala International.

The gym was crowded and noisy, so I had to move closer to hear what she had to say. The girls&#x2019; volleyball team was practicing at one end and Samantha was at the other end, barking orders like a gorgeous blond drill sergeant. I couldn&#x2019;t hear Samantha from where I stood, but whatever she said sent her minions scurrying.<p></p> I smothered a sigh. Penny had never been one of my favorite people, but I thought she&#x2019;d changed over the last few months. Apparently, I was wrong.<p></p> "What rumor?" I said, not really wanting to hear the answer.<p></p> "That you and Ryan are shoo-ins for king and queen of the Midnight Ball." She smiled at me and I caught a glimpse of the kinder, gentler Penny.<p></p> "I hope not," I said. "Samantha&#x2019;s been working really hard on the ball. I hope she and Sean win." Samantha Devereaux was my best friend, who for a time had been my worst enemy &#x2014; or at least a thorn in my side &#x2014; and was back to being my best friend again.<p></p> We&#x2019;d been through a lot during our junior year at Nightshade High, but I was expecting smooth sailing for our senior year. Or as smooth as it could be, considering that we lived in a town that was a little different, to say the least.<p></p> "Samantha&#x2019;s definitely a contender," Penny said. "Especially since everyone who is a resident of Nightshade gets to vote."<p></p> "Well, please tell everyone I don&#x2019;t want another crown." Last year, I&#x2019;d been crowned homecoming queen in a bizarre turn of events. I didn&#x2019;t want to sound ungrateful, but that was enough glory for me. Samantha thrived in the spotlight. I did not. Now that she and I were finally friends again, I wasn&#x2019;t going to let some tinsel crown come between us.<p></p> Penny gave me a half wave and headed to the locker room. I watched her go.<p></p> "Daisy, look out!" Samantha warned me as a giant orange jack-o&#x2019;-lantern rolled down the aisle. I put out a hand and concentrated. It rolled to a stop in the nick of time and narrowly missed squashing me flat.<p></p> You had to stay on your toes when you lived in Nightshade, and having psychic powers helped. I looked around the gym to see if anyone had noticed my public psychic slip, but everyone&#x2019;s attention was on the volleyball game going on at the other end.<p></p> "Halloween is over a month away, you know," I said, gesturing toward the bright decoration.<p></p> Samantha peered at me from behind a huge box of orange and black streamers, cardboard black cats, and ghosts. "It&#x2019;s not just any Halloween," she replied. "It&#x2019;s Nightshade&#x2019;s two hundredth anniversary celebration. I&#x2019;m one of the chairs."<p></p> "I know. I was just telling Penny how hard you&#x2019;ve been working." Samantha volunteered for practically every committee the high school had. Now that it was finally our senior year, she didn&#x2019;t seem to be slowing down at all.<p></p> "Gotta go!" I said, as I remembered the other thing Sam liked to do, which was rope me into volunteering for whatever pet project she was involved in. I&#x2019;d wait for Ryan somewhere far, far away from my volunteering happy friend.<p></p> "Don&#x2019;t you dare take a step out that door, Giordano!" she said, only half teasing.<p></p> I repressed a sigh. Sam was unstoppable. Besides, I had to admit, I had fun when I was around her. At least, most of the time.<p></p> "I have plans for those psychic powers of yours," she continued. "How else are we going to hang these decorations on the ceiling?"<p></p> "Okay, if you promise not to try to squash me with a squash again."<p></p> "Who&#x2019;s trying to murder you this time?"Ryan said. He put his arm around me and gave me a hello kiss. My boyfriend was the best thing about senior year, although I had to push away the thought of what would happen to us once we graduated. I&#x2019;d worry about that when the time came.<p></p> "Hi,Ryan," Sam said."Where&#x2019;s Sean? He promised me he&#x2019;d help." Sean was Samantha&#x2019;s boyfriend and Ryan&#x2019;s best friend.<p></p> "He&#x2019;s still in the locker room," Ryan replied. "But he mentioned you guys might need another hand."<p></p> Samantha&#x2019;s momentary irritation at her boyfriend disappeared. "Can you haul these outside?"<p></p> Ryan took the box from Samantha. "Where do you want these?"<p></p> "I rented a truck," she replied. "It&#x2019;s in the first stall in the parking lot." The first stall in the parking lot was Principal Amador&#x2019;s, but if anyone could get away with commandeering his spot, it would be Samantha.<p></p> Sean walked up, carrying a green gym bag under his arm.<p></p> "What took you so long?" Samantha said.<p></p> "Sorry, babe," he replied. "I got caught up talking to Wolfgang." She made a face. "What were you doing talking to him?" "He&#x2019;s helping Coach with the stats," Sean said. "I can&#x2019;t ignore him." "Why not?" she replied. "After what he did this summer, he deserves to be ignored." Wolfgang Paxton was a freshman who had been giving some of the football players a little something extra in their Wheaties, and the summer had ended with half the football team becoming werewolves. The ones who weren&#x2019;t already, I mean. Fortunately, the side effects of Wolfgang&#x2019;s "hairballs" turned out to be temporary.<p></p> "Don&#x2019;t worry," Sean said, soothing her. "He&#x2019;s calmed down since the summer." Samantha held out her hand. "Keys, please. I need to take this stuff to the Wilders."<p></p> Sean opened his bag and dug through the contents. He didn&#x2019;t notice when a heavily embossed envelope fell out and landed on the polished floor.<p></p> I stooped down and picked it up. I wasn&#x2019;t trying to be nosy, but the blood-red wax seal aroused my curiosity. It looked like a fancy invitation, with creamy white stationery that was silky to the touch.<p></p> I handed it to Sean. "That&#x2019;s not mine," he said. He shoved the envelope into a pocket, then peered into the bag. "I must have grabbed the wrong bag." He hurried off to the locker room.<p></p> He returned a few minutes later, carrying an almost identical gym bag. "I grabbed Wolfie&#x2019;s by mistake."<p></p> Sam checked her watch. "C&#x2019;mon," she said."We&#x2019;re late."<p></p> Ryan and I just stood there until Samantha barked out, "Are you coming?"<p></p> "Coming where?" I said.<p></p> "The Wilder mansion," she replied. "I&#x2019;m storing stuff there until we can clean up the haunted house."<p></p> "What haunted house?"<p></p> "That old deserted mansion up by the Wilders&#x2014;Merriweather House. It&#x2019;s going to be the centerpiece of the town celebration. We&#x2019;re having the Midnight Ball there. It&#x2019;s supposed to be haunted."<p></p> "It sounds . . . monumental," I said aloud, but I was thinking that it sounded like a monumental amount of hard work. Everyone in town knew the dance would be the culmination of the anniversary events, but I had just assumed it would be held at the Wilder estate, which was the biggest, fanciest place in town.<p></p> After loading the truck, Ryan and I got in his car and followed Samantha and Sean to the Wilder estate.<p></p> "How&#x2019;s your dad?" Ryan asked.<p></p> "He&#x2019;s . . . okay," I said.<p></p> "That bad, huh?"<p></p> Another thing I loved about Ryan. He could tell what I really wanted to say, without me having to say it.<p></p> "He&#x2019;s getting better, but he&#x2019;s still . . ."<p></p> "Distant?" Ryan guessed.<p></p> I nodded. "He says he doesn&#x2019;t want to talk about it." My Dad had been through a traumatic experience. Most of Nightshade had thought he&#x2019;d run off with another woman, but the truth was he&#x2019;d been abducted and held captive by the Scourge, an anti-paranormal group. Mom had rescued Dad from their clutches, but not until he had been gone for six long years.<p></p> Dad hadn&#x2019;t left the house much at all since his return. Mom had made a few tentative noises about him going back to teaching, but he hadn&#x2019;t even called his old department at the university. He even talked about writing a book, but I hadn&#x2019;t seen any evidence that he was actually working on it.<p></p> The Wilder mansion was one of the oldest places in Nightshade. We pulled up the long driveway and parked. There was a restaurant on the property, but it only took up a minuscule part of the main house.<p></p> Samantha rang the doorbell, and it was the elegant Mrs. Wilder herself, the elderly matriarch of the shifter clan and the owner of the estate, who answered the door. She pointedly looked at her watch and said, "We start serving dinner in one hour."<p></p> "We&#x2019;ll be finished by then," Samantha promised. "Excellent," Mrs. Wilder replied. "Bianca will show you the way."<p></p> Bianca materialized from the shadows. Bianca worked at Wilder&#x2019;s Restaurant, but her duties didn&#x2019;t end there. Bianca was a shape-shifter, too. She took the form of a sweet looking black kitten, but looks could be deceiving.<p></p> Instead of the severely chic dresses I was accustomed to seeing her in, she was dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt. She still managed to look gorgeous. A familiar looking envelope with a red seal was shoved into the back pocket of her jeans. Interesting.<p></p> "Hi, Bianca," I said.<p></p> "Daisy," she said. "Did you get your letter already?"<p></p> "Letter?" I said, confused. My mind flashed to the heavy envelope Sean had dropped earlier.<p></p> "You haven&#x2019;t received it yet? Oh, forget I said anything."<p></p> When I frowned, she added, "Don&#x2019;t fret. It&#x2019;s not anything bad. I just don&#x2019;t want to spoil the surprise."<p></p> "If you say so," I replied. I&#x2019;d had enough surprises to last a lifetime. She smiled.<p></p> "I do." Bianca handed Samantha a key. "Mrs. Wilder has instructed me to give you the key to the room you&#x2019;ll be using to store the decorations. This way, please."<p></p> Bianca&#x2019;s midnight-black hair was in a ponytail and it swayed back and forth hypnotically as she led us to a part of the mansion I&#x2019;d never been to.<p></p> We went through rooms even more luxurious than the converted restaurant and ballroom. Sean couldn&#x2019;t keep his astonishment in check and let out a low whistle.<p></p> "These are the estate&#x2019;s guest rooms," Bianca said. "It&#x2019;s documented that a famous buccaneer once stayed in one of the bedrooms."<p></p> We finally reached stairs much less opulent than the ones near the front entrance. The surroundings grew shabby.<p></p> "This part of the house is rarely used," Bianca explained. The wallpaper was faded and torn in places, and I detected the distinct odor of dust and mold, combined with a less familiar smell.<p></p> We reached our destination and Bianca motioned for us to enter. We stepped into an enormous room. A row of long narrow windows flanked one wall. At the opposite end, there was a jumble of tables and chairs, and a couple of large trunks. There was even a framed oil painting propped against a dressmaker&#x2019;s dummy. I couldn&#x2019;t decide what to look at next.<p></p> I set down the box I&#x2019;d been carrying. "This is amazing!"<p></p> "Well, I&#x2019;ll leave you to it," Bianca said. "Daisy, I&#x2019;ll see you later."<p></p> After Bianca left, Samantha said to Sean, "Be an angel and get the folding table first."<p></p> "What are you going to do with the folding table?" I asked, after Ryan and Sean left.<p></p> "We don&#x2019;t have nearly enough decorations," she replied. "Even with the stuff I&#x2019;ve managed to borrow. So, we&#x2019;re going to make more," she said.<p></p> "Who is we?" I said suspiciously.<p></p> "Relax, Daisy," she said. "I&#x2019;ve already asked the cheerleading squad to help."<p></p> "Great," I said.<p></p> "I have bigger plans for you," she said. "I thought you could whip up something for the volunteers to snack on."<p></p> "How many volunteers?"<p></p> "Just a few," she said airily. "I asked Mrs. Wilder if we could use the kitchen here, but she said her new chef is temperamental."<p></p> "I can make some simple stuff," I said.<p></p> I had thought I was getting off easily, but my muscles were aching by the time we&#x2019;d hauled all the supplies to the room. Half of the stuff would have to be moved again when we set up the haunted house.<p></p> After we were finished, Ryan took me home, even though Sean lived next door.<p></p> "Want to come in?" I was sweaty and tired, but he&#x2019;d been busy with football practice the last few days and I hadn&#x2019;t seen much of him.<p></p> "Nah, I&#x2019;d better not," he said. He shifted in his seat uncomfortably. I knew what he was thinking. Despite my best efforts, he and my dad hadn&#x2019;t really clicked.<p></p> "Let&#x2019;s go out tomorrow night," I said. "It&#x2019;s Friday."<p></p> He gave me a hug. "That sounds great, but I know you want to spend time with your dad."<p></p> "I want to spend time with you, too. How about Slim&#x2019;s?"<p></p> Slim&#x2019;s Diner was where I worked part-time, but business there had slowed down. Lately I&#x2019;d only been working the occasional Saturday. It worried me. I didn&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;d do if Slim&#x2019;s went out of business. Nightshade wouldn&#x2019;t be Nightshade without the diner.<p></p> "Side Effects May Vary is playing at the Black Opal," Ryan said. "But maybe we can hit Slim&#x2019;s after the show."<p></p> The front porch light went on, which was my signal to kiss Ryan good night.<p></p> When I went inside, my dad was waiting for me.<p></p> "Where have you been?" he demanded. His hands were shaking.<p></p> "Helping Samantha," I said. "Are you okay?"<p></p> "Then why did Ryan bring you home?" That&#x2019;s what his agitation was all about.<p></p> I drew in my breath. "Ryan was helping, too. And he brought me home because he&#x2019;s my boyfriend and he wants to be with me," I said. "You like Ryan, remember?" Dad had never seemed to have a problem with Ryan back when we were little kids who played in the sandbox together, but it was a different story now.<p></p> It was hard for me to remember how happy I had been when Mom brought Dad home. Even though I was mad at him, at least it wasn&#x2019;t a doppelganger I was fighting with, which had happened when someone had created doppelgangers of Nightshade residents and tried to pass them off as the real people. This was my real dad and we were having our first real fight.<p></p> I stomped up the stairs &#x2014; ignoring his "Daisy, come back here!"&#x2014; and made a beeline for my room, but Poppy waylaid me outside the door.<p></p> "What was that all about?" Poppy asked.<p></p> "Dad again," I admitted."I don&#x2019;t know what his problem is with Ryan."<p></p> "It&#x2019;s not Ryan," she said. "It&#x2019;s you."<p></p> "Huh?"I said. I had no clue what Poppy was talking about.<p></p> "Think about it," she said. "You&#x2019;re the baby, and when Dad disappeared, you were twelve."<p></p> "I&#x2019;m following you so far," I said.<p></p> "Well, when he came back, he probably still had that image of you in his mind. But you&#x2019;re not twelve anymore. And Ryan just reminds him of that."<p></p> "What can I do to make it easier?" I asked.<p></p> "Just give him time," she said. "He needs to get used to the idea that you&#x2019;re not his little girl anymore."<p></p> "Makes sense," I said. "How&#x2019;d you get so wise?"<p></p> "Psychology 101," she replied. "I love college!"<p></p> My two older sisters, Poppy and Rose, both attended UC Nightshade. Poppy had just started her freshman year and Rose was a sophomore.<p></p> I retreated to my room, less angry at my dad, but still not in the mood to deal with him. I knew he&#x2019;d been through a lot, but so had the rest of the family. My mom most of all. And for everyone&#x2019;s sake I needed to try to be more patient with my father.<p></p> With that in my mind, I went to find him in the kitchen. "Something smells good," I said.<p></p> Dad held up a spoonful of marinara sauce. "Want a taste?"<p></p> "Sure," I said. Dad was a great cook, possibly even better than I was.

He was also included in Don Allen's seminal anthology, "The New American Poetry 1945-1960." A child prodigy, Meltzer performed on radio and TV in New York beginning in the late '40s. In 1957, after a few years in Los Angeles, where he was part of the circle around Wallace Berman's <em>Semina</em> magazine, Meltzer moved to San Francisco, where he associated with such poets as Allen Ginsberg, Robert Duncan and Jack Spicer. One of the pioneers of jazz poetry readings, Meltzer also formed a psychedelic folk-rock group called Serpent Power with his wife Tina Meltzer and poet Clark Coolidge, recording for Vanguard Records in the late '60s. He continues to perform with the music and poetry review, Rockpile. In addition to his many books of poetry, Meltzer also published 10 erotic novels in the late '60s and early '70s, including the critically-acclaimed <em>Agency Trilogy</em>, revisiting the genre in 1995 with "Under." He has edited many anthologies, including the book of interviews, <em>San Francisco Beat: Talking with the Poets</em> (City Lights, 2001). He also taught for many years in the poetics program at New College of California. In 2005, Penguin Books published <em>David's Copy: The Selected Poems of David Meltzer</em>. Lawrence Ferlinghetti has called him "one of the greats of post-World-War-Two San Francisco poets and musicians."</p><p>"With this primal book, David Meltzer takes his place among the great poets of his generation."&#x2014;Lawrence Ferlinghetti</p><p>"An erudite man with interests that range from Jewish mysticism to jazz, Meltzer is anything but bookish. He writes quick, wry poetry, embedded with wisdom, his short lines delivered in a dancing street vernacular that gathers force as it uncovers fresh discoveries."&#x2014;Bart Schneider, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></p><p>"Meltzer's work has always been quirky, lyrical, and fresh with a self-respect that jumps right off the page and invites readers into the delight of expression."&#x2014;<em>Bloomsbury Review</em></p><p>"For Meltzer, the experience of being a poet is inextricable from the experience of the body in a way that is simultaneously physical and spiritual."&#x2014;Julie Babcock, <em>Rain Taxi</em></p><p>"Take a poet&#x2019;s life work and distill it into pure essence&#x2014;it will look like When <em>I Was a Poet</em> by David Meltzer (City Lights Books). Having fully lived, the Beat legend stands at the abyss and peers down (and back). In these poems we grow. 'Grow to know / Death&#x2019;s musk / on the cusp.' These double-stressed lines are simple to the point of lift-off. In elegizing, chronicling, assessing, and questioning, Meltzer kindles the word pyre so we can see ourselves, naked and candle-smudged. He writes what the light has 'sewn together.' Here, hear, 'The poem angels sing, arising.'"&#x2014;Jeffrey Cyphers Wright, <em>The Brooklyn Rail</em></p></p><h2>The Mask of Power: Cynder Confronts the Weather Wizard #5 (Skylanders Universe)</h2><p><b>The Skylanders are back!</b><br><br><i>Cynder Confronts the Weather Wizard</i> is the fifth book in the ongoing Mask of Power series of original novels set in the Skylanders universe. In this book, Cynder travels to the Isle of the Undead to find out why storm clouds are gathering over the Cloudless Desert.</p><p>Onk Beakman has devoted his life to chronicling the greatest adventures of the Skylanders. Though he was hatched on the icy wastes of Skylands&#x2019;s Frozen Desert, this book-loving penguin now lives in a shack on the beautiful sands of Blistering Beach with his two pet cucumbers.<p></p><p>Onk Beakman knew he wanted to be a world-famous author from the moment he was hatched. In fact, the book-loving penguin was so excited that he wrote his first novel while still inside his egg (to this day, nobody is entirely sure where he got the tiny pencil and notebook from).</p><p>Growing up on the icy wastes of Skylands&#x2019; Frozen Desert was difficult for a penguin who hated the cold. While his brothers plunged into the freezing waters, Onk could be found with his beak buried in a book and a pen clutched in his flippers.</p><p>Yet his life changed forever when a giant floating head appeared in the skies above the tundra. It was Kaos, attempting to melt the icecaps so he could get his grubby little hands on an ancient weapon buried beneath the snow.</p><p>Onk watched open-beaked as Spyro swept in and sent the evil Portal Master packing. From that day, Onk knew that he must chronicle the Skylanders&#x2019; greatest adventures. He traveled the length and breadth of Skylands, collecting every tale he could find about Master Eon&#x2019;s brave champions.</p><p>Today, Onk writes from a shack on the beautiful sands of Blistering Beach with his two pet sea cucumbers.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter One</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yeah,&#x201d; said Zook, reaching for another coconut drink. &#x201c;This is the life, right, Cynder?&#x201d;</p><p>Beside the Bambazooker, the dark purple dragon shifted uncomfortably beneath the shade of a large umbrella.</p><p>&#x201c;Speak for yourself, Bamboo Boy,&#x201d; she said with a sigh. &#x201c;Remind me again why we&#x2019;re lying on a beach?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To soak up the sun, why else?&#x201d; The green-barked Life Skylander slurped the creamy coconut milk noisily. &#x201c;This is the Cloudless Desert, the sunniest spot in all of Skylands. Just kick back and relax, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you don&#x2019;t feel guilty that we&#x2019;re wasting our time when we should be out looking for the next segment of the Mask of Power?&#x201d; Cynder snapped, her scaly brow furrowing. She glanced around, taking in the countless Mabu out enjoying a day in the sun. Didn&#x2019;t they realize the danger they were all in? Kaos was trying to reassemble the fabled Mask of Power. If he managed it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, hey, hey, just chill,&#x201d; insisted Zook, settling back in his deck chair. &#x201c;If Master Eon needs us, he knows where to find us.&#x201d;</p><p>The buzz of the happy vacationers was broken by a sharp crack that sounded like the universe being pulled in two. Cynder was immediately on her feet. She knew that sound. It was a Portal!</p><p>She spun around to see a column of light blaze into existence. A figure materialized at its heart. It was tall, regal, and more than a little spooky.</p><p>Cynder grinned. Zook wanted to chill and you couldn&#x2019;t get more chilling than this new arrival: Hex!</p><p>The elven sorceress swept from the Portal, her piercing gaze passing over the beach.</p><p>All around, there were gasps and even a few whimpers. Like Cynder, Hex was an Undead Skylander&#x2014;a mistress of dark magic and feared by many. Hex&#x2019;s ghost-white eyes shimmered as she watched the vacationers frantically pack up their towels and beach chairs, deciding that there was something else they&#x2019;d rather be doing. Like getting trapped in a spider-infested cave or fed to a pack of zombies.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up, Hexy?&#x201d; called Zook in greeting. &#x201c;You here to catch the rays?&#x201d; The Bambazooker peeked over his pair of ridiculously large sunglasses. &#x201c;You do look like you could use a tan.&#x201d;</p><p>Hex&#x2019;s narrow mouth turned down at the corners. She wasn&#x2019;t known for her sense of humor. She was known for striking fear into everyone&#x2019;s hearts, which was quite different.</p><p>&#x201c;Master Eon needs you,&#x201d; she replied, her voice like wind whistling through a graveyard. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to &#x2018;catch the rays&#x2019; another time.&#x201d; Her disgust at the very concept was obvious. Hex was more at home in moonlight than in the warmth of the sun.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it the mask?&#x201d; Cynder said eagerly, feeling an electric thrill run through her wings. &#x201c;Has Eon located the next segment?&#x201d;</p><p>But Hex didn&#x2019;t answer. Instead she peered into the sky, a puzzled look on her ashen face.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought this place was known as the Cloudless Desert?&#x201d; she commented, floating up from the blisteringly hot sands.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Zook confirmed contentedly. &#x201c;Not a cloud in the sky.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Except that one,&#x201d; Hex muttered, cocking her head to the side in curiosity.</p><p>Cynder followed the witch&#x2019;s gaze. She was right. A tiny cloud had appeared in the expanse of brilliant blue. A cloud that was growing, and growing fast. A shadow fell over the sands as the three Skylanders gazed up in amazement. In a matter of seconds the cloud had smothered the sky, becoming darker with every passing minute.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, who turned off the sun?&#x201d; complained Zook, throwing aside his shades and snatching up his bazooka. Fun-loving and carefree he may have been, but Zook recognized a threat when he saw one.</p><p>So did Cynder. Her expression was darkening as quickly as the sky. This was no natural storm.</p><p>&#x201c;It is the power of Darkness,&#x201d; cried Hex. She threw her arms out wide, and crackling phantom orbs appeared in her upturned palms. &#x201c;The forces of nature have turned against us.&#x201d;</p><p>Cynder felt a drop of rain on her nose, followed by another. A moment later, the heavens opened, and water lashed down from those strange storm clouds.</p><p>&#x201c;It could just be a quick shower,&#x201d; joked Zook, ever the eternal optimist. &#x201c;I mean, who ever got hurt by a few drops of rain?&#x201d;</p><p>There was a scream from their left. The Skylanders turned to see a Mabu sinking into the soggy sand. He was already up to his waist in the quagmire. All around, fleeing vacationers were getting stuck, before getting dragged beneath the dunes.</p><p>Cynder could feel the grip of the wet ground pulling her claws down into a clammy embrace.</p><p>&#x201c;We need to do something,&#x201d; she yelled, flapping her leathery wings to pull herself free with a wet squelch. &#x201c;The dunes are turning into quicksand. Everyone is going to be sucked underground!&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Cynder soared through the air, snatching a sun-worshipping Mabu from the cloying quicksand and flying him to safety. The rain beat down on her wings the whole time, making it difficult to fly. She wouldn&#x2019;t be able to rescue them all.</p><p>&#x201c;Zook!&#x201d; she cried out, spotting another Mabu&#x2014;who was wearing a flowery sunhat&#x2014;almost vanishing beneath the surface. &#x201c;Behind you!&#x201d;</p><p>The Bambazooker turned, his eyes growing wide when he spotted the stricken Mabu. &#x201c;Hang on, little buddy,&#x201d; he shouted out as he splashed through the quagmire.</p><p>&#x201c;T-to what?&#x201d; stammered the horrified tourist.</p><p>&#x201c;To these!&#x201d; Zook clapped his hands together and bamboo shoots erupted around the sinking Mabu from beneath the sand. Usually, Zook used his foliage barriers for protection&#x2014;today they would be a lifeline.</p><p>&#x201c;Great idea, Zook,&#x201d; Cynder called down. &#x201c;Can you summon them all over the beach?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No problem,&#x201d; the Bambazooker yelled back, spinning in a circle. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s Zook it up!&#x201d;</p><p>Bamboo shoots popped up here, there, and everywhere.</p><p>&#x201c;Grab hold of the bamboo,&#x201d; Cynder yelled to the Mabu who were still floundering in the mud. &#x201c;And hang on to them until I can get to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The rain is getting worse,&#x201d; Zook pointed out. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure how long the bamboo will last.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Long enough,&#x201d; murmured Hex, rising up into the air, sinister wreaths of emerald smoke swirling around her hands.</p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d; Zook asked.</p><p>&#x201c;For the Darkness to fall!&#x201d; Hex cried out, reaching her hands up to the heavens. Smoke bloomed from her open palms, shooting into the clouds above as the elven witch recited a spell in a language not spoken for thousands upon thousands of years. There was a loud CRACK, and the sky flashed a brilliant green. Even Cynder had to look away from the sudden unnatural flare.</p><p>When the dragon looked again the clouds were scuttling away like giant, fluffy spiders.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, hows about that?&#x201d; Zook laughed. &#x201c;Instant summer. Heh-heh!&#x201d;</p><p>Sure enough, beams of sunlight were poking through the retreating clouds, the rain clearing away to nothing.</p><p>Not that heros had time to bask in the sun. &#x201c;Quick, everyone,&#x201d; Cynder snapped, snatching a Mabu out of the drying dunes. &#x201c;Get clear of the sand before it gets baked hard by the heat. You don&#x2019;t want to get stuck.&#x201d;</p><p></p></p><h2>One Wore Blue (Camerons Saga: Civil War Trilogy)</h2><p><b>Heather Graham&#x2019;s seductive Civil War trilogy begins with an unlikely Yankee forced to choose between loyalty to the cause and the love of a Southern belle.</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>The privileged daughter of a Virginia plantation owner, Kiernan Miller can&#x2019;t imagine that her idyllic life will ever change&#x2014;nor her days in the company of her devastatingly handsome neighbor, Jesse Cameron, a boy who returns her desire, kiss by tempestuous kiss.

Romance Writers of America presented Heather Graham with the RWA Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003.Prologue <br> &nbsp;<br> KIERNAN<br> &nbsp;<br> Kiernan&#x2019;s world, it seemed, had split in two.<br> &nbsp;<br> One side was blue, and one side was gray.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ever since it began to come apart, everything had changed. All that had been beautiful in life had begun to fade. A way of life that had been full of charm and wit and easy grandeur had passed away. They were holding on to it tightly, but it was gone. The world was split apart, and families were split apart&#x2014;like Camerons.<br> &nbsp;<br> One wore blue, and one wore gray.<br> &nbsp;<br> One had been her childhood friend back in Tidewater Virginia. He and Kiernan had tramped through fields together, they had been chastised together. They had told their dreams to each other during long lazy days when they had lain by pleasant, bubbling springs beneath powder-blue skies.<br> &nbsp;<br> And the other Cameron brother had been her hero. As a child, she had adored him. As a woman, she had loved him. And when the world had changed, she had hated him&#x2014;fiercely, desperately, as passionately as she had loved him. She had her beliefs, and she had her loyalties.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was just that she had loved him so long....<br> &nbsp;<br> Even when she had stood before the altar with another man and promised to love and honor and cherish that man until death did them part, she had loved him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Almost as much as she had hated him.<br> &nbsp;<br> She had told him that she hated him the day that she walked away from him.<br> &nbsp;<br> But he had been destined to ride back into her life that day, Kiernan would later realize.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jesse. Jesse Cameron.<br> &nbsp;<br> The one who wore blue.<br> &nbsp;<br> It began very late in the afternoon of that autumn day in 1861, when the breeze was cool, when the mountains seemed the most gentle.<br> &nbsp;<br> They came against the beautiful fall colors of the twilight. They were like a great wave, cresting and falling, rising again. Beneath the dying sun they seemed to weave and undulate. A piece of metal&#x2014;a belt buckle, a sword&#x2014;would catch a ray of the fading light, and it would flash and shimmer. They came onward still, visible almost like a writhing snake one moment, then disappearing into shadow the next. When they disappeared, the peace, the tranquillity of the coming night in the Blue Ridge Mountains, seemed to deny that they could exist. Here, where fall came so gently and so beautifully, where those last rays of sun and the coming shadow fell upon oaks and rolling fields of green and amber, here at Montemarte, they could not possibly exist.<br> &nbsp;<br> But they did.<br> &nbsp;<br> And still they came. Men marching, and more men on horseback. Rows and rows of soldiers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kiernan Miller could see them on the distant mount as she stood by the old oaks in the summer garden of Montemarte. In the dim light, it was difficult to see what color they wore. But even as she watched them, she felt panic and dismay rise within her. Her hand flew to her throat, as if she could swallow her despair.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Confederates had pulled out of the nearby town of Harpers Ferry&#x2014;she knew that. They had blown up the munitions there and pulled out. They were still near&#x2014;she knew that too&#x2014;but they had no large numbers, and so the horde slowly but surely rising toward her had to be Yanks.<br> &nbsp;<br> As they came closer, she could see the blue uniforms&#x2014;standard Federal issue. Union Army. They weren&#x2019;t deserters or guerrilla fighters.<br> &nbsp;<br> There could be only one reason for them to be riding toward Montemarte.<br> &nbsp;<br> To burn it to the ground.<br> &nbsp;<br> She stood very still, only her bright, beautiful green eyes betraying the depths of her tension. The night breeze rippled through the gold and honey-rich fire of her hair. Her slim form was as straight as the old oaks. In better times, she might have been a picture of elegance, for the breeze also touched upon the fullness of her fine gown&#x2014;white eyelet over a full silver-blue skirt and a low-cut bodice with French puff sleeves. It was a beautiful gown, right out of the pages of Lady Godey&#x2019;s. She didn&#x2019;t know why she bothered to dress for evenings anymore, except that she had found herself plunged into a new world, and she was fighting to hang on to the traditions she knew so well.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Yankees were coming.<br> &nbsp;<br> She wanted to scream, and she wanted somewhere to run. She wanted to cast this information upon one of the many gallants she had known in her life. And she wanted one of them to stand up and sweep her up and promise her that everything would be all right, that she would be cherished and protected.<br> &nbsp;<br> But there was nowhere to run, and no one to run to. Inside the house, the children would have seen the men by now. They would be coming to her. She would have to have something to say to them. It was doubtful that she could save the house&#x2014;Miller firearms had already been used too successfully against the Union. She had to save her charges, though, and the slaves dependent upon her.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the Yankees were coming....<br> &nbsp;<br> A cavalry unit was leading, with infantry in the back, she realized. There must have been a hundred soldiers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly, even as they headed nearer and nearer her, the party split. Half now headed toward her, and half toward the Freemont estate down the hill.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Kiernan! Yankees! For the love of God, Yankees!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Kiernan swung around. Patricia, her twelve-year-old sister-in-law, stood on the front porch, her fingers clenched into her skirt.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was curious how very lovely Patricia Miller looked. She, too, had dressed for dinner. Her blond hair hung in a single braid down her back, and her muslin gown filled with soft lilac flowers. She was framed by the house, the gracious and elegant house that looked so very beautiful and welcoming in the twilight.<br> &nbsp;<br> Montemarte sat upon the hill on the outskirts of Harpers Ferry. Like others in the area, the Millers had found their riches in the production and manufacture of arms, and Montemarte was a monument to those riches. It was not a plantation home but a magnificent manor. There were stables for the horses that had once been the Miller family pride. There were gardens to feed the household, and there were gardens for beauty, but there were no fields for income&#x2014;just the manor with its classic white Greek columns, and the stables and outbuildings.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Kiernan&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know, I know!&#x201d; Kiernan told her softly. &#x201c;The Yankees are coming.&#x201d; With a sigh she squared her shoulders and fought off a last temptation to burst into tears. She lifted her skirts and hurried for the porch. &#x201c;Patricia, they&#x2019;re going to want to burn the house.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No! They can&#x2019;t! What will we do? Where will we go?&#x201d; Patricia asked, tears in her wide brown eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite its beauty, Montemarte was just a house, Kiernan told herself. Their home, yes, but still just a creation of brick and wood and mortar and plaster. They were not destitute; she could bring the Miller children to her father&#x2019;s home, deep in Tidewater Virginia, on the peninsula, where the Yankees would dare not come lest they met up with Stonewall Jackson or General Lee.<br> &nbsp;<br> She knew why Patricia was so desperate. The war had scarcely begun, but already Patricia had lost everyone. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for Kiernan&#x2019;s reckless marriage to Patricia&#x2019;s brother, not even Kiernan would be here now for the children.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; she told Patricia. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be fine, whatever happens.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Like hell!&#x201d; snapped a voice, and Kiernan&#x2019;s eyes quickly rose to meet those of Patricia&#x2019;s twin brother, Jacob Miller. Brown-eyed and tow-headed like Patricia, he was already very tall and very straight, and he carried his father&#x2019;s old rifle. He gazed at Kiernan with hurt and with knowledge that shouldn&#x2019;t have been seen in eyes so very young. &#x201c;Bad things are happening in a lot of places, Kiernan. Lots of bad things. You&#x2019;d best get yourself and Patricia hid somewhere.&#x201d; There was a catch in his throat. &#x201c;&#x2019;Tricia&#x2019;s young yet, but when them Yanks see you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Jacob,&#x201d; Kiernan said, and lowered her head to hide a smile. He meant to defend her honor&#x2014;to the death. She had heard some of the same stories about the invading Union Army that he had, but she couldn&#x2019;t believe that fifty men, riding with such discipline, were coming to dishonor one lone woman. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to be all right. They&#x2019;re coming because of the Miller Firearms Factories. It&#x2019;s revenge, I&#x2019;m afraid, but nothing more.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Kiernan&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She set her hand upon the rifle, lowering it. &#x201c;Jacob Miller, you can&#x2019;t take on an entire Union cavalry company. In memory of your parents and Anthony, I have to make sure that you grow up and live to a ripe old age. Do you understand?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to burn us out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Probably, yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And you want to just surrender the place to them?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, Jacob.&#x201d; She offered them both a grave smile. &#x201c;I want to make the evening as wretched for them as we possibly can. I want you both to go back inside. One of you sit in the library and read a book. One of you go and make sure that Janey has started supper. I&#x2019;ll stay and meet them on the porch, and when they order us to go, we&#x2019;ll go. But on our own sweet time, and with lots of dignity.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jacob still looked as if he wanted to start shooting. Dear God, the twins had always listened to her in the past! She prayed that Jacob wouldn&#x2019;t pick this moment to defy her.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Solitude of Ravens</h2><p>Exceptionally rare first U.S. PB edition, published 1991 by Bedford Arts.

After the Stones unceremoniously dumped him as manager during the Summer of Love, Oldham more or less disappeared from the rock 'n' roll mapAproducing a few artists here and there and living off his past success. But as shown by this delightful cut-and-paste romp (interviews with Oldham spliced together with comments from other hipsters such as designer Mary Quant, the Who's Pete Townshend and writer Nik CohnAbut, curiously, no interviews with any of the Stones), Oldham's memories are not only sharp, insightful and full of gossip, but also reflect that he has probably forgotten more about the music business in his fast-paced early life than most of his peers can claim to know. The Stones don't appear until halfway through the book, but the pre-1963 material is perhaps the most intriguing part of Oldham's memoir. As he moved from posh schools to '50s lowlife to early '60s social scenes, Oldham probably met every big name and con artist who ever populated London or the south of FranceAfrom Picasso (from whom he bummed money) to infamous producers Mickie Most and Phil Spector. The wealth of information, details and larger-than-life stories about the London music scene before the Beatles and the Stones that Oldham recounts provides a valuable record of a fertile and fascinating, albeit overlooked, cultural era. At 19, he may have known "nothing about the music biz," as Pete Townshend confirms, but as a "worldly-wise" purveyor of '60s excess who may have blown his mind way back when, Oldham proves today with this hotter-than-hot-for-hard-core-fans memoir that he has never lost his sense or sensibility. 60 b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Winter Count</h2><p>From the American Book Award-winning author of Arctic Dreams comes a timeless, intoxicating collection of evocative stories. In these exquisite tales, an explorer goes mad when faced with the disappearance of a river; blue herons descend upon Manhattan; a lonely desert hermit clears a path for a secret celestial wind; and more.</p><p>If science seeks to demystify life, literature can restore a needed measure of wonder to it. Or, as one of the characters in Barry Lopez's collection of short stories <i>Winter Count</i> puts it, "If you are careful, I think there is probably nothing that cannot be retrieved."<p> Much indeed is retrieved in Lopez's pages, first published in 1981: lost species, lost memories, lost emotions. In one especially Borgesian story, a university professor seeks to puzzle out the facts behind 19th-century reports of a herd of white buffalo that, singing, pointed a way into heaven. In another, a young man catches a glimpse into the workings of the stars and planets in an unlikely corner of the Arizona desert. In still another, a traveler recapitulates the pain of lost love while contemplating the graceful flight of herons. </p><p> Lopez's marvelous stories are about many things. Underlying them is a shared precision of language and vision, a precision that characterizes the author's works of nonfiction (<i>Of Wolves and Men</i>, <i>Arctic Dreams</i>). Behind Lopez's stories as well is a quiet insistence on the centrality of nature--an awareness of which, he suggests, can make the busiest city livable, and the deepest wounds of the heart bearable. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>"Perfectly crafted. . . . [These] stories expand of their own accord, lingering in the mind the way intense light lingers in the retina." --"Los Angeles Times <br>"Animals and landscapes have not had this weight, this precision, in American fiction since Hemingway's young heroes were fishing the streams of upper Michigan and Spain." --"San Francisco Chronicle <p>Aflock of great blue herons descending through a snowstorm to the streets of New York. . . . A river in Nebraska disappearing mysteri-ously. . . . A ghostly herd of buffalo that sings a song of death. . . . A mystic who raises constellations of stones from the desert floor. . . . All these are to be found in Winter Count, the exquisite and rapturous collection by the National Book Award-winning author of Arctic Dreams. </p><p>In these resonant and unpredictable stories Barry Lopez proves that he is one of the most important and original writers at work in America today. With breathtaking skill and a few deft strokes he produces painfully beautiful scenes. Combining the real with the wondrous, he offers us a pure vision of people alive to the immediacy and spiritual truth of nature. <br>"Powerful. . . . [Lopez] can steal your breath away." --"Minneapolis Tribune <br>"Richly allusive, moving, compassionate, these stories celebrate the web of nature that holds the world together." <br>--"The Philadelphia Inquirer</p></p><h2>Laughter in the Dark</h2><p>Albinus - rich, married middle-aged and respectable - is an art critic and aspiring filmmaker who lusts after the coquettish young cinema usherette Margot.

Visit her online at www.martaperry.com.<br><br>"You are the only one who can find the truth, Meredith. You must do it."<br><br>Meredith King stared in dismay across the small cafe table at her cousin Sarah. With her hair drawn tightly back under her <em>kapp</em> and her simple Amish dress, Sarah seemed an unlikely person to be urging her cousin to investigate a death that had occurred twenty years ago. But worry had driven lines around Sarah's normally placid blue eyes, and she reached one hand across the table in pleading.<br><br>"I'm not sure what I can do." That came out sounding much less definite than Meredith had hoped. "Aaron drowned twenty years ago. There's probably nothing left to learn."<br><br>And a small-town accountant shouldn't be anyone's idea of a crusader. Her weekly coffee klatch with her Amish cousin had turned in a direction Meredith had never anticipated.<br><br>"But it was your looking into what happened that summer that brought about this talk of Aaron killing himself. Yours and Rachel's," Sarah added. "You've already found out so much&#x2014;surely you can discover the rest of it."<br><br>Meredith couldn't argue that she'd resurrected the talk about Aaron Mast's death, no matter how she might want to. When her childhood friend, Rachel Weaver Mason, had come back to Deer Run several months earlier, they'd started reminiscing about the events of that summer when they'd been ten and had shared a childish crush on the Amish teenager.<br><br>Aaron had been the hero of the imaginary world they'd created that summer. But the world had come crashing down when Aaron died in the pond below Parson's Dam. What started as harmless wondering about the events of that summer had also ended in uncovering the probability that Aaron had committed suicide.<br><br>"I'm sorry we ever started poking into it," Meredith said, guilt settling across her shoulders like a heavy blanket. "We certainly didn't intend to cause grief to his family."<br><br>"Please, Meredith. I can't go asking questions among the <em>Englisch,</em> but you can." Sarah gestured to her Amish dress as if in explanation.<br><br>True enough. An action that would be unthinkable for an Amish matron was possible for Meredith.<br><br>"Besides, you know as much as anybody about that summer, following Aaron around like you did." Sarah must have sensed her hesitation and pressed on. "I know you were just a girl, but you didn't forget our Aaron, ain't so?" The possessive way Sarah spoke suggested that Aaron had meant something special to her.<br><br>"Aaron was a friend of yours, then?" She should have realized that Sarah, ten years older than Meredith, would have been about Aaron's age.<br><br>"Friend, <em>ja."</em> Sarah's gaze seemed to lose focus, as if she looked into the past. "More than friends, once." She shook her head, becoming again the mature Amish wife and mother. "But this talk of suicide hurts so many people. The Aaron I knew would not do such a thing."<br><br>"Sometimes we don't know others as well as we think." For example, she'd never guessed that there had been any love in Sarah's life other than her husband, Jonah. "Even if I can think of a way to find out more, you might not be happy with the result."<br><br>"If Aaron really did this thing, I will bear it." Sarah's voice was firm. "We all will. But we must know for certain sure."<br><br>Meredith was silent for a moment, trying to find a way to refuse. She didn't want to bring still more heartache to people who'd already suffered so much.<br><br>But Sarah was the closest link she had to her father and the Amish side of her family. For their sake, she couldn't refuse to do as Sarah asked, could she?<br><br>"I'll try," she said at last. "I don't know if I can help, but I'll try."<br><br><em>"Denke,</em> Meredith." Tears shone in Sarah's blue eyes as she clasped Meredith's hand. <em>"Da Herr sie mit du."</em><br><br><em>The Lord be with you.</em> She'd certainly need the help if she were to solve a twenty-year-old mystery.<br><br>"Meredith?" Anna Miller called from behind the counter of the combination grocery store/tourist stop/ coffee shop that had served the village of Deer Run as long as Meredith could remember. "Your mother has called, saying why are you so late and don't forget the goat's milk she wants. I have it ready for you."<br><br>"Thanks, Anna." She stood, wishing she could stay long enough to wipe the worry from Sarah's face, but knowing her mother was perfectly capable of calling every five minutes until Meredith showed up. That was why she'd muted the ringer on her phone.<br><br>"I'd better go." She touched Sarah's shoulder lightly as her cousin stood, gathering her purchases. "Give my love to Jonah and the children."<br><br>Sarah nodded. "I would say the same to your <em>mamm,</em> but I think it would not be <em>wilkom, ja?"</em> She gave a wry smile and turned toward the grocery section of the shop.<br><br>Since everyone in the valley knew of Margo King's antipathy to her late husband's Amish kin, there was little point in pretending it was otherwise. So Meredith just nodded and went to the counter to pick up the quart of goat's milk Anna had ready.<br><br>"Thanks, Anna."<br><br>"It makes no trouble," Anna said, although it had to be a bit of a chore to make a separate trip just to pick up the milk, especially when, like Anna, one drove a horse and buggy to do so.<br><br>"Well, I appreciate it." She handed over the money.<br><br>"You're a <em>gut</em> daughter," Anna said as Meredith turned toward the door. "Ain't so, Jeannette?" She appealed to the woman who'd just entered the shop.<br><br>Jeannette Walker's smile, as always, seemed to curdle a bit when she turned it on Meredith. "I'm sure she must be." Since Jeannette's bed-and-breakfast, the Willows, stood directly across the street from Meredith's house, she no doubt thought she had ample opportunity to judge.<br><br>"It's nice to see you, Jeannette." Meredith gave the expected greeting and attempted to reach the door, but Jeannette stood in her path, and she seemed in no hurry to move.<br><br>"Don't rush off yet," she said. "I haven't had a chance to tell you my news." Jeannette patted the tightly permed curls that made her look older than the fortysomething she probably was.<br><br>Funny, the difference between her and Sarah even though they were probably about the same age. Sarah, with no makeup, plain dress and her hair pulled back from a center part under her white <em>kapp,</em> still looked younger than Jeannette.<br><br>"Is something new in the bed-and-breakfast business?" she asked, even though she wasn't exactly panting to know.<br><br>"You might say that." Jeannette's gaze sharpened on Meredith's face. "I have a guest coming in today. An old friend of yours, I think."<br><br>"Really?" It seemed unlikely that one of her friends was coming to stay at the Willows, but she supposed stranger things had happened. "Who is it?"<br><br>"Well, you're just not going to believe it when I tell you." The faint look of triumph on Jeannette's face made Meredith vaguely uncomfortable. "I'm sure he was once a special friend of yours."<br><br>Meredith's fingers tightened around the milk bottle, and somehow she already knew whose name was coming out of Jeannette's mouth.<br><br>"Zachary Randal." Jeannette proclaimed the name loudly enough that everyone in Miller's Shop could hear it. "Now, tell me I'm not wrong. You two were an item once upon a time, weren't you?"<br><br>The smile on Meredith's face was probably frozen, but it had nothing on the icy hand that gripped her heart at the name. Zach Randal, returning to Deer Run after thirteen years? Surely not. He'd made it plain enough when he'd stormed away from her that he would never come back.<br><br>"Zach Randal?" Anna joined the conversation, diverting Jeannette's focus, thank goodness. "Well, that is interesting news. It'll be nice to see how that boy turned out after all these years."<br><br>Jeannette's expression suggested she smelled something nasty. "Not very well, I'm sure. If anyone had asked me, I'd have said he'd be in prison by this time."<br><br>Meredith discovered she was still capable of being roused to anger on Zach's behalf. "If that's so, why did you rent a room to him?"<br><br>Jeannette shrugged, spreading her hands wide. "I run a business, after all. What can I do? But I'm surprised you didn't suggest he stay at your friend Rachel's little inn."<br><br>Rachel ran Mason House, a thriving new B and B that was giving the Willows a run for its money. But never mind the barb&#x2014;Jeannette was fishing for a response. She was probably torn between wanting to be the only person who knew of Zach's imminent arrival and her desire to find out if Meredith was still in touch with him.<br><br>The thought of exposing her feelings in public kept Meredith's spine straight and her face composed. "There's no reason for Zach to contact me about his plans."<br><br>"So sad." Jeannette shook her head as if in sympathy, but her gaze was that of a robin with its eyes on a succulent worm. "When you were once so very close."<br><br>"Just casual friends," she said, knowing full well that everyone in the store probably saw that for the lie it was. Knowing, too, that she couldn't keep this front up much longer. "Excuse me. I must get home."<br><br>She brushed past Jeannette and hurried out the door, trying not to look as if she were running away.<br><br>She didn't run away. She'd never been able to. Running away was what Zach had done. She had just provided the reason.<br><br>Zach had expected he'd have some time to adjust to being back in Deer Run before his inevitable first sight of Meredith King. He'd been wrong. As he pulled up in front of the Willows, Meredith was letting herself in the gate to her front yard, right across the street.<br><br>He could have stayed at a big, anonymous motel out on the interstate, but conducting this business had become a matter of pride to him. If he had to come back to Deer Run, he'd come, and nobody here could intimidate him again.<br><br>Including Meredith. He slammed the car door, making her face turn toward him, and started across the road. Sauntering, not hurrying. He'd greet her like any nearly forgotten acquaintance he hadn't seen in years. He'd show both her and himself that nothing remained of their long-vanished love.<br><br>That was easier said than done, given the fact that just the sight of her made him feel as if he'd been rammed full-on by a semi.<br><br>He came to a halt a few feet from her. Meredith stood still, just looking at him, her hand arrested with the gate half-open.<br><br>"Meredith." Luckily his voice came out as cool as he'd hoped. Undercover work had honed his acting skills. "It's been a long time."<br><br>He might have hoped to find that his first love had turned into a frazzled housewife carrying an extra twenty pounds and with a whining toddler in tow. She hadn't. If Meredith had added any weight since she was seventeen, it had certainly gone to the right places. The lovely girl she'd been had turned into a beautiful woman.<br><br>"Thirteen years," she said. She seemed to realize that she was gripping the gate tightly, and she let it swing closed, creating a barrier between them. "How are you, Zach?"<br><br>"Doing fine." He probably resembled the drug dealer he'd been posing as, with his tight, well-worn jeans, hair over his collar and stubble on his jaw. Fine. Let Deer Run think ill of him. It always had.<br><br>Meredith, on the other hand, looked like a polished professional woman with her shining brown hair worn in a sleek, just-below-the-chin cut, neat slacks and a soft coral sweater, with a touch of gold at ears and wrist.<br><br>Not on her hands, though. He'd seen that bare ring finger first thing.<br><br>"I just learned from Jeannette that you were coming." Those big brown doe eyes focused on his face. "I was surprised."<br><br>He managed a short laugh. "I'd say appalled was closer to the truth, right?" That came out sounding more bitter than he'd intended.<br><br>"Just surprised. Because I remember hearing you swear that Deer Run had seen the last of you." Those full lips might have trembled for an instant on the words.<br><br>"We talk a lot of nonsense when we're seventeen, right?" <em>Things like I love you. I'll always love you.</em><br><br>He shrugged. "It was time I dealt with the property I own here. Had a few vacation days coming, so I figured I'd clear things up."<br><br>"I see." She glanced away, as if at a loss for something else to say.<br><br>He could remember when it seemed they'd never run out of things to say to each other. They'd walk around town in the summer twilight, sharing secrets and dreams as if they were two parts of a whole.<br><br>Meredith seemed to regain her poise after the momentary lapse. "I guess this visit won't be much of a vacation from work for you. What are you doing now?"<br><br>He raised an eyebrow, wondering how she'd react. "Police. Detective Zachary Randal, Pittsburgh P.D., believe it or not. I imagine most people in Deer Run expected me to end up on the other side of the bars."<br><br>"I'm sure that's not true." A faint flush touched her cheekbones, denying the words.<br><br>"Come on, Meredith." He put his hand on the gate, dangerously close to hers. "We both know what this town thinks of me."<br><br>"Deer Run has changed," she protested.<br><br>He took an obvious look down the street at the same lineup of century-old Victorian houses and small shops. A few cars were parked in front of the grocery store, an Amish horse and buggy was hitched at the side of the hardware store. The village snoozed under the shelter of the mountain ridge that seemed to cut it off from the rest of the world.<br><br>"Really? Looks the same to me." He raised an eyebrow and had the satisfaction of seeing a spark of anger in those brown eyes.<br><br>"You shouldn't judge what you don't know." Her chin came up, reminding him of the sensitive good girl who'd still had the courage to date the bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks.<br><br>The front door of the house rattled, and a high, sweet voice called out, "Meredith? Come inside, please. I need you."<br><br>The door closed again. Apparently Margo King had her daughter so well trained that she didn't need to call twice.<br><br>Meredith half turned away from the gate. "I'm sorry. I have to go in."<br><br>"Yeah. Right." Bitterness welled up, raw in his throat. "I see one thing hasn't changed at all."<br><br>Before she could answer he turned and walked away, his fists clenching as he tried to stamp down feelings he'd been sure had died a long time ago.<br><br></p><h2>Choosers of the Slain</h2><p>When a lone Antarctic British outpost is taken over by Argentinian forces, the U.S. sends the U.S.S.

It was formed from land once inhabited by the Cherokees and came into existence in the early 1800s. Descendants of Scottish, Irish, and English lineage became the predominant settlers in the area. Many generations of "mountain people" in Union County have led lives filled with determination, endurance, resourcefulness, and self sufficiency.<p>Those character traits continue to be evident among those who call one of America's most scenic areas home. Part of the Chattahoochee National Forest covers approximately one-half of the land in Union County-much of it wilderness as it has been for centuries. From the mountain peaks to the lakes, along the roadways and wilderness trails, Union County features flowing streams, waterfalls, native animals, spectacular flora, and magnificent views of abundant forests. This volume will delight readers as they journey through the history of such areas as Choestoe, Arkaquah, Brasstown, Gum Log, Ivy Log, Dooley, Young Cane, Coosa, Owltown, Cooper's Creek, Gaddistown, Suches, and Blairsville. This pictorial chronicle brings to life the perseverance of those who have gone before, providing a record of their contributions and accomplishments.</p></p><p></p><h2>Silicon States: The Power and Politics of Big Tech and What It Means for Our Future</h2><p><b>Named a Best Book of the Year by <i>Esquire</i><br> Winner of the 800-CEO-READ Business Book Award in Current Events and Public Affairs</b><br><br> In an era when faith in government and its institutions is quickly eroding, the businesses of Silicon Valley are stepping in to fill the gap. With outsize supplies of cash, talent, and ambition, a small group of corporations have been gradually seizing leadership&#x2015;and consumer confidence&#x2015;around the world. <br><br> In <i>Silicon States</i>, renowned futurist and celebrated international think-tank leader Lucie Greene offers an unparalleled look at the players, promises, and potential problems of Big Tech. Through interviews with corporate leaders, influential venture capitalists, scholars, journalists, activists, and more, Greene explores the tension inherent in Silicon Valley's global influence. If these companies can invent a social network, how might they soon transform our political and health-care systems? If they can revolutionize the cell phone, what might they do for space travel, education, or the housing market? As Silicon Valley faces increased scrutiny over its mistreatment of women, cultural shortcomings, and its role in widespread Russian election interference, we are learning where its interests truly lie, and about the great power these companies wield over an unsuspecting citizenry.<br><br> While the promise of technology is seductive, it is important to understand these corporations' possible impacts on our political and socioeconomic institutions. Greene emphasizes that before we hand our future over to a rarefied group of companies, we should examine the world they might build and confront its benefits, prejudices, and inherent flaws. <i>Silicon States</i> pushes us to ask if, ultimately, this is the future we really want.</p><p><b>LUCIE GREENE</b> is the worldwide director of the Innovation Group, J.

But as a woman, she gets only grudging respect from her community's Council of Elders. While Edie is leading two tourists on a hunting expedition, one of them is shot and killed. The Council wants to call it an accident, but Edie and police sergeant Derek Palliser suspect otherwise. When the other tourist disappears, Edie sets off into the far reaches of the tundra for answers.</p><p>A stunning debut novel, <i>White Heat</i> launches a formidable new series set amidst an unforgiving landscape of ice and rock, of spirit ancestors, and never-rotting bones.</p></p><p>M. J. McGrath is an award-winning journalist and the author of <i>The Long Exile: A Tale of Inuit Betrayal</i>. She was awarded the Mail on Sunday/John Llewellyn Rhys Prize for best British writer under thirty-five, and currently lives in London.As she set a chip of iceberg on the stove for tea, Edie Kiglatuk mulled over why it was that the hunting expedition she was leading had been so spectacularly unsuccessful. For one thing, the two men she was guiding were lousy shots. For another, Felix Wagner and his sidekick Andy Taylor hadn&#x2019;t seemed to care if they made a kill nor not. Over the past couple of days they&#x2019;d spent half their time gazing at maps and writing in notebooks. Maybe it was just the romance of the High Arctic, they were after, the promise of living authentically in the wild with the Eskimo, like the expedition brochure promised. Still, she thought, they but they wouldn&#x2019;t be living long if they couldn&#x2019;t bring down something to eat.<br><br>She poured the boiling berg water into a thermos containing <i>qungik</i>, which white people called Labrador tea, and set aside the rest for herself. You had to travel more than 3000 kilometres south from <i>Unmingmak Nuna</i>, Ellesmere Island, where they were now, to find <i>qungik</i> growing on the tundra, but for some reason southerners thought Labrador tea was more authentic, so it was what she always served to her hunting clients. For herself, she preferred Soma brand English Breakfast, brewed with iceberg water, sweetened with plenty of sugar and enriched with a knob of seal blubber. In any case, what really mattered was not the kind of tea as the fact that it was brewed with melted berg. A client once told her that in the south, the water had been through the bowels of dinosaurs before it even reached the faucet, whereas berg water had lain frozen and untouched by animal or human being pretty much since time began. Just one of the reasons, Edie guessed, that southerners were prepared to pay tens of thousands of dollars to come up this far north. In the case of Wagner and Taylor, it certainly wasn&#x2019;t for the hunting.<br><br> Some time soon these two were about to get a deal more High Arctic authenticity than they&#x2019;d bargained for. Not that they knew it yet. While Edie had been fixing tea, the wind had changed; squally easterlies were now sweeping in from the Greenlandic ice cap, suggesting a blizzard was on its way. Not imminently, but quite soon. There was still plenty time enough to fill the flasks with tea and get back to the gravel beach where Edie had left the two men sorting out their camp.<br><br>She threw another chunk of berg into the can and while the water was heating, she reached into her pack for her wedge of<i> igunaq</i> and cut off a few slices of the fermented walrus gut. The chewing of igunaq took some time, which was part of the point of <i>igunaq</i>, and as Edie worked the stuff between her teeth she allowed her thoughts to return to the subject of money and from there to stepson, Joe Inukpuk, who was the chief reason she was out here in the company of two men who couldn&#x2019;t shoot and one of whom, the tall, skinny fellow, the sidekick Taylor, was also a particular pain in the ass. Guiding paid better than the teaching that took up the remainder of her time, and Joe needed money if he was to get his nurse&#x2019;s qualification. He couldn&#x2019;t expect to get any help from Sammy, his father and Edie&#x2019;s ex, or from his mother Minnie, so the money was going have to come from Edie. Edie didn&#x2019;t spook easily&#x2014;it took a lot to frighten an ex-polar bear hunter - but it scared her just how badly she wanted Joe to be able to do his nursing training. The Arctic was full of <i>qalunaat</i> professionals; white doctors, white nurses, lawyers, engineers and there was nothing wrong with most of them, but it was time Inuit produced their own professional class. Joe was certainly smart enough and he seemed committed. If she was thrifty and lucky with clients, she thought she could probably save enough this coming summer to put him through the first year of school. Guiding hunting expeditions was no big deal, like going out on the land with a couple of toddlers in tow. She already knew every last glacier, fiord or esker for five hundred miles around better than she knew the contours of her own body. And no one knew better than Edie how to hunt.<br><br>The bit of berg had melted and she was unscrewing the top of the first thermos when a sharp, whipping crack cut through the gloom and so startled her that she dropped the flask. The hot liquid instantly vaporised into a plume of ice crystals, which trembled ever so slightly in disrupted air. The hunter in her knew that sound, the precise, particular pop of 7mm ammunition fired from hunting rifle, something not unlike the Remington 700s her clients were carrying.<br><br>She squinted across the sea ice, hoping to a clue as to what had happened, but her view of the beach was obscured by the berg. Up ahead, to the east of the beach, the tundra stared blankly back, immense and uncompromising. A gust of wind whipped frost smoke off the icepack. She felt a surge of irritation. What the hell did the<i> qalunaat</i> think they were doing when they were supposed to be setting up camp? Firing at game? Given their lack of enthusiasm for the shoot, that seemed unlikely. Maybe a bear had come too close and they were letting off a warning shot, though if that were the case, it was odd that her bear dog, Bonehead, hadn&#x2019;t picked up the scent and started barking. A dog as sensitive to bear as Bonehead could scent a bear a couple of kilometres away. There was nothing for it but to investigate. Until they got back to the settlement at Autisaq, the men were officially her responsibility and these days, Edie Kiglatuk took her responsibilities seriously.<br><br>She retrieved the flask, impatient with herself for having dropped it and spilled the water, then, checking her rifle, began lunging at her usual, steady, pace through deep drift towards the snowmobile. As she approached, Bonehead, who was tethered to the trailer, lifted his head and flapped his tail. Definitely no bear he could smell. Edie gave the animal a pat and tied in her cooking equipment. As she was packing the flasks under the tarp, a sharp, breathless cry flew past and echoed out over the sea ice and Bonehead began to bark. In an instant, Edie felt her neck stiffen and a thudding started up in her chest.<br><br>Someone began shouting for help. The voice sounded like it belonged to the tall, skinny one. Fool had already forgotten the advice she&#x2019;d given them to stay quiet when they were out on the land. Up here, shouting could bring down a wall of ice or an avalanche of powder snow. It could alert a passing bear. She considered calling out to him to stop hollering, but she was downwind from the hunters and knew her voice wouldn&#x2019;t carry.<br><br>Hissing to Bonehead to shut up, to herself she said: &#x2018;<i>Ikuliaq</i>!&#x2019; Stay calm!<br><br>One of the men must have had an accident. It wasn&#x2019;t uncommon. In the twelve years she&#x2019;d been guiding southern hunters, Edie had seen more of those than there are char in a spawn pond; puffed up egos, in the Arctic for the first time, laden down with self-importance and high-tech kit, neither of which they really knew how to handle, thinking it was going to be just like the duck shoot in Iowa they went on last Thanksgiving or the New Year&#x2019;s deer cull in Wyoming. Then they got out on the sea ice and things didn&#x2019;t seem quite so easy. If the bears didn&#x2019;t spook them, then the blistering cold, the scouring winds, the ferocious sun and the roar of the ice pack usually did the job. They&#x2019;d stave off their fear with casual bravado and booze and that was when the accidents began.<br><br>She set the snowbie going and made her way around the iceberg and through a ridge of <i>tuniq</i>, slabby pressure ice. The wind was up now and blowing ice crystals into the skin around her eyes. When she pulled on her snowgoggles, the crystals migrated to the sensitive skin around her mouth. She felt less like a human being than one of those voodoo dolls she&#x2019;d seen on TV. So long as no one had been seriously wounded, she told herself, they could all just to sit out the storm and wait for help to arrive once the weather had calmed. She&#x2019;d put up a snowhouse to keep them cosy and she had a first aid kit and enough knowledge to be able to use it.</p><h2>Elizabeth I: Her Life in Letters</h2><p>Queen Elizabeth (1533-1603) ruled England for 45 turbulent years and her reign has come to be seen as a golden age. She exercised supreme authority in a man&#39;s world, while remaining intensely feminine. This volume has been published to commemorate the 400th anniversary of her death in 1603. It illustrates in colour and (where possible) actual size, a selection of 60 manuscripts - either by Elizabeth or to her - from the British Library, Public Record Office, Hatfield House and other great libraries. Each is accompanied by a commentary, explaining the document and placing it in its historical context. Elizabeth was a girl of extraordinary precocity and a brilliant linguist. Her early letters, written in a beautiful italic, are to her forbidding father, Henry VIII, and to her brother and sister, Edward VI and Mary. Also included in the book are highly dramatic letters exchanged with Mary Queen of Scots; declarations of love from the Earl of Essex, followed a few pages on by her signed warrant for his execution; and a letter from Tsar Ivan the Terrible, who rounds on her in a blind fury after she refuses to marry him.</p><p>"An inimitable collection of documents giving insight into one of the most public and yet most enigmatic of English monarchs, <i>Elizabeth I</i> peers behind the carefully fashioned veil with which Queen Elizabeth dissembled and cloaked her persona."&#x2014;Thomas G.

Reprint.</p><p>Turn-of-the-century Toronto makes an evocative setting for murder in <i>Except the Dying</i>, a skillful first novel that is interesting both for its historical accuracy and its fully realized characters. The plot concerns the murder of a young housemaid, discovered naked in a snowy lane, and the cast of suspects spans the social strata. Yet it is William Murdoch, the detective in charge of the case, who breathes life into what might otherwise have been a conventional murder mystery. As he pursues his quest for justice, Murdoch also mourns the death of his fianc�e; his manner of doing both reveals a compassionate, principled man--one whose fictional endeavors (readers hope) have only just begun.In the cold Toronto winter of 1895, the unclad body of a servant girl is found frozen in a deserted laneway. Detective William Murdoch quickly finds out that more than one person connected with the girl?s simple life has something to hide.</p><h2>Three Screenplays by Edward Burns</h2><p>This first-ever collection of screenplays by the young filmmaking prodigy with a heart of gold and a bit of blarney includes the screenplay of Burns&#39; new movie, &#34;Long Time, Nothing New&#34;, plus &#34;The Brothers McMullen&#34; and last year&#39;s hit, &#34;She&#39;s the One&#34;. Photos throughout.</p><p>Lauded by critics and audiences alike, Burns gained international recognition for his first feature THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN, which premiered in competition at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival, winning the Grand Jury prize. The film, which Burns wrote, directed and starred in, was shot on a budget of only $25,000 and went on to gross over $10 million at the domestic box office, making it the most profitable film of 1995. The film also won &#34;Best First Feature&#34; at the 1996 Independent Spirit Awards. Burns&#39; second film, the romantic comedy SHE&#39;S THE ONE starring Jennifer Aniston and Cameron Diaz, reinforced Burns&#39; versatile talent as a writer, director, and actor. Burns continues to write, direct, star in and produce his films, including SIDEWALKS OF NEW YORK, THE GROOMSMEN and PURPLE VIOLETS. NICE GUY JOHNNY is his 9th feature film as a writer, director and actor. Ed Burns was born in Woodside, Queens and raised on Long Island.</p><h2>Vija Celmins &amp; Eliot Weinberger: The Stars</h2><p>New York artist Vija Celmins has made many images of the night sky--paintings, drawings and prints of gorgeous richness. In <i>The Stars</i>, she and her collaborator, the essayist and translator Eliot Weinberger, devote an artist's book to the theme. Celmins created three celestial prints for the project, which she also designed. One print, inspired by the worn binding of an early twentieth-century Japanese book, becomes the volume's mottled deep-blue cover; the second and third prints are images of the night sky, one of them negative--dark stars on a pale ground. For the text, Weinberger assembled a catalogue of descriptions of the stars drawn from around the world, and from an array of historical, literary and anthropological sources. This mythopoetic charting of the night sky evokes the vastness of the human imagination's response to a space itself vast and unknowable. Appearing in English and also in Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Japanese and Maori, the text supplements Celmins's images visually as well as verbally. <i>The Stars</i> was originally a limited-edition <i>livre d'artiste</i> published this year by the Library Council of The Museum of Modern Art.</p><p>Vija Celmins has received international attention for renditions of natural scenes, which are often copied from photographs that lack a point of reference, horizon or discernable depth of field. She renders these spaces - seascapes, night skies and the barren desert floor - with an uncanny accuracy, working for months on a single image. A master of several mediums, including oil painting, charcoal and multiple printmaking processes, Celmins matches a tangible sense of space with sensuous detail in each work. She currently lives in New York and California. Eliot Weinberger was born in 1949 in New York City, where he still lives. He is the primary translator of Octavio Paz into English. His most recent publications are the collection of essays Karmic Traces: 1993-1999 and a translation of Bei Dao&#39;s Unlock (with Iona Man-Cheong). He is also the editor of The New Directions Anthology of Classical Chinese Poetry (2003).</p><h2>Bridge of Spies: A True Story of the Cold War</h2><p>Who were the three men the American and Soviet superpowers exchanged at Berlin's Glienicke Bridge and Checkpoint Charlie in the first and most legendary prisoner exchange between East and West? <i>Bridge of Spies</i> vividly traces their paths to that exchange on February 10, 1962, when their fate helped to define the conflicts and lethal undercurrents of the most dangerous years of the Cold War.<br><br><i>Bridge of Spies</i> is the true story of three extraordinary characters &#x2013; William Fisher, alias Rudolf Abel, a British born KGB agent arrested by the FBI in New York City and jailed as a Soviet superspy for trying to steal America&#x2019;s most precious nuclear secrets; Gary Powers, the American U-2 pilot who was captured when his plane was shot down while flying a reconnaissance mission over the closed cities of central Russia; and Frederic Pryor, a young American graduate student in Berlin mistakenly identified as a spy, arrested and held without charge by the Stasi, East Germany&#x2019;s secret police.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>By weaving the three strands of this story together for the first time, Giles Whittell masterfully portrays the intense political tensions and nuclear brinkmanship that brought the United States and Soviet Union so close to a hot war in the early 1960s. He reveals the dramatic lives of men drawn into the nadir of the Cold War by duty and curiosity, and the tragicomedy of errors that eventually induced Khrushchev to send missiles to Castro. Two of his subjects&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;the spy and the pilot&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;were the original seekers of weapons of mass destruction. The third, an intellectual, fluent in German, unencumbered by dependents, and researching a Ph.D. thesis on the foreign trade system of the Soviet bloc, seemed to the Stasi precisely the sort of person the CIA should have been recruiting. He was not. In over his head in the world capital of spying, he was wrongly charged with espionage and thus came to the Agency&#x2019;s notice by a more roundabout route. The three men were rescued against daunting odds by fate and by their families, and then all but forgotten. Yet they laid bare the pathological mistrust that fueled the arms race for the next 30 years. <br>&nbsp;<br>Drawing on new interviews conducted in the United States, Europe and Russia with key players in the exchange and the events leading to it, among them Frederic Pryor himself and the man who shot down Gary Powers, <i>Bridge of Spies </i>captures a time when the fate of the world really did depend on coded messages on microdots and brave young men in pressure suits. The exchange that frigid day at two of the most sensitive points along the Iron Curtain represented the first step back from where the superpowers had stood since the building of the Berlin Wall the previous summer &#x2013; on the brink of World War III.</p><p>Giles Whittell is the Washington, DC bureau chief for the <i>Times of London</i>. He has been the <i>Times</i>&#x2019; correspondent in Moscow and Los Angeles and has written four previous books including two about the break-up of the Soviet empire.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>1</i><br>THE WATERSPOUT</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Shock and awe was not invented for Saddam Hussein. It was invented for Joseph Stalin, and it worked pretty well.<br>&nbsp;<br>On July 24, 1946, as most of Russia slept, a team of U.S. Navy frogmen guided a heavy steel container to its final resting place in the clear waters of Bikini Lagoon, 2,500 miles west of Honolulu. They stabilized it with cables ninety feet below an anchored amphibious assault ship that gloried in the name <i>LSM-60. </i>The container was made from the conning tower of the USS <i>Salmon, </i>a scrapped navy submarine, and inside it was a working replica of the plutonium bomb that had killed eighty thousand people at Nagasaki the previous year. That evening, on a support vessel outside the lagoon, the frogmen ate T-bone steaks with all the trimmings.<br>&nbsp;<br>Around the <i>LSM-60, </i>like giant moon shadows on the water&#x2019;s calm surface, a target fleet of eighty-five more ships spent that night emptied of crew and supplies, with no role left except to sink. One of the closest to the bomb was the USS <i>Arkansas, </i>a 27,000-ton battleship that had carried President Taft to Panama before the First World War and bombarded Cherbourg and Iwo Jima in the Second. For most of her life the only way for a battleship to go down had been with guns blazing, but the nuclear age had changed that. It turned out that with the help of an atom bomb a battleship could go down like a toy in a bath. It could be flicked onto its bow and rammed into the seabed so that its superstructure fell off as if never even bolted on.<br>&nbsp;<br>Shortly after breakfast time on the morning of the twenty-fifth, the <i>Arkansas </i>was photographed from every angle as the bomb in the steel container was detonated 170 yards from her hull. Cameras in a B-29 bomber twenty-five thousand feet above the lagoon and a little to the south captured the sight of a huge disc of ocean turning white in an instant. That was the water beneath the <i>Arkansas </i>being vaporized.<br>&nbsp;<br>The shockwave from the initial blast rolled the ship onto her side and ripped off her propellers. A six-thousand-foot column of spray and water, created in about two and a half seconds, then heaved her into a vertical position in which two thirds of her length were clearly visible ten miles away, dwarfed by the largest man-made waterspout in history. She has lain upside down on the floor of the lagoon ever since.<br>&nbsp;<br>The <i>Arkansas </i>was one of ten ships sunk outright by what came to be known as the Baker shot. It was the second of two nuclear tests conducted at Bikini with undisguised panache as the world adjusted to an awesome new technology (and to the daring swimsuit it inspired; the first-ever bikini, presented in Paris that month, was called <i>l&#x2019;atome, </i>and the second was a buttock-baring thong described by one fashion writer as what the survivor of a nuclear blast could expect to be wearing as the fireball subsided).<br>&nbsp;<br>Participation in the tests by U.S. military personnel was voluntary but popular. In shirtsleeves and sunglasses, 37,000 men extended their wartime service for a year to help set up the tests and to see for themselves the power of the weapon that had brought Japan to its knees.<br>&nbsp;<br>Pat Bradley was there, up a tree with a movie camera on Bikini atoll to film the blast and the tsunami it produced&#x2014;a single ninety-foot wave that subsided before it hit the island, then three smaller waves. &#x201c;It took a couple of minutes before the first wave came in to the atoll,&#x201d; he remembered. &#x201c;The second came in higher, then the third completely covered the island four to six feet deep.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>A lean and thoughtful young air force captain named Stan Beerli was there too. He had survived the world war in B-17 bombers over Italy and would survive the cold war in the regulation dark suit of the CIA. His tasks would include trying to keep Gary Powers and the U-2 in the shadows where they belonged, but for the time being the cold war was pure spectacle.<br>&nbsp;<br>The foreign and domestic press were welcome at Bikini. The Baker shot was witnessed by 131 reporters, including a full Soviet contingent. With Warner Bros.&#x2019; help, the Pentagon released a propaganda film of the blast for anyone who had missed the initial coverage, and Admiral William &#x201c;Spike&#x201d; Blandy, who oversaw the operation, posed with his wife cutting an angel food cake in the shape of a mushroom cloud.<br>&nbsp;<br>Responding to public anxiety before the blast, Blandy promised that he was &#x201c;not an atomic playboy&#x201d; and that the bomb would not &#x201c;blow out the bottom of the sea and let all the water run down the hole.&#x201d; This was true, but it could still do a lot of damage. In the summer of 1947 <i>Life </i>magazine published a long article based on official studies of the intense radioactive fallout from the Baker bomb. It concluded that if a similar weapon were to explode off the tip of Manhattan in a stiff southerly wind, two million people would die.<br>&nbsp;<br>America had finished the war with a pair of atom bombs and started the peace in the same way. President Truman&#x2019;s message to Stalin could not have been clearer if written in blood. It was a warning not to contemplate starting a new war in Europe trusting in the Red Army&#x2019;s old-fashioned strength in numbers. And it signaled more concisely than any speech that Truman had accepted the central argument of George Kennan&#x2019;s famous &#x201c;Long Telegram,&#x201d; sent from the U.S. embassy in Moscow six months before the tests: the Soviet Union had to be contained. As Truman himself put it: &#x201c;If we could just have Stalin and his boys see one of these things, there wouldn&#x2019;t be any question about another war.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Stalin refused to be intimidated. He had not sacrificed twenty million people to defeat Fascism only to be told where to set the limits on Stalinism. And yet he had a problem.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the time of the Bikini tests, the Soviet Union was still three years and a month from exploding its first nuclear weapon. Its efforts to build one were under way on a bend in the Shagan River in eastern Kazakhstan, under the direction of a bearded young hero of Soviet science (and tightly closeted homosexual) named Igor Kurchatov. Stalin had deemed the bomb &#x201c;Problem Number One.&#x201d; He had created a special state committee to ensure that no expense was spared in solving it. Whole mountains in Bulgaria had been commandeered to give Kurchatov the uranium he needed. But Kurchatov was not an innovator. He was a nuclear plagiarist, almost completely dependent on intelligence from left-leaning scientists in the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos. As he admitted in a 1943 memo to the Council of People&#x2019;s Commissars, this flow of intelligence had &#x201c;immense, indeed incalculable importance for our State and science&#x201d;&#x2014;but in 1946 the flow had slowed suddenly to a trickle.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just a year earlier, not one but two descriptions of the first bomb tested at Los Alamos were in the Kremlin nearly two weeks before it even exploded. After that test, more detailed diagrams of the device reached Moscow than were provided in the first official nuclear report to Congress. One was smuggled out of Albuquerque in a box of Kleenex. Atomic espionage was never more bountiful than this. But on November 7, 1945, Elizabeth Terrill Bentley, a thirty-seven-year-old graduate of Vassar and a paid-up Soviet agent, went to the FBI with a 107-page description of Soviet intelligence activities in North America. The following day J. Edgar Hoover sent a secret memo to the White House based on Bentley&#x2019;s material. It produced few arrests because she offered scant supporting evidence, but her defection forced Moscow to shut down most of the channels feeding nuclear secrets to Kurchatov.<br>&nbsp;<br>There were other reasons why Soviet espionage in the United States was grinding to a halt. Victory in the war had removed the most compelling reason for scientists at Los Alamos to share designs with their former Soviet allies&#x2014;the defeat of Nazism. And the U.S. Army had at last begun decoding encrypted Soviet cable traffic, code-named Venona, that corroborated many of Bentley&#x2019;s allegations.<br>&nbsp;<br>Without vital intelligence from the true pioneers of nuclear fission in New Mexico, Kurchatov would not be able to complete the bomb. Without the bomb, the most that the Soviet empire could hope to do was defend its interminable frontiers. As the Bikini lagoon erupted, the outlook for international Communism looked bleak indeed. Yet from the bowels of the Lyubianka&#x2014;headquarters of the KGB and the true engine room of the revolution&#x2014;there came a glimmer of hope.</p><h2>The Female Economy: The Millinery and Dressmaking Trades, 1860-1930 (Women in American History)</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hemmed in by "women's work" much less than has been thought,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women in the late 1800s and early 1900s were the primary entrepreneurs<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the millinery and dressmaking trades.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Female Economy</i> explores that lost world of women's dominance,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; showing how independent, often ambitious businesswomen and the sometimes<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imperious consumers they served gradually vanished from the scene as custom<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; production gave way to a largely unskilled modern garment industry controlled<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by men.

His campaign had given voice to a public exhausted by World War I and President Wilson&#39;s debilitating stroke. He promised the American people that, under his watch, life and governance would once again be manageable. But after he died unexpectedly in the spring of 1923, Harding&#39;s legacy was soon tarnished by scandals not of his making. In this wise and compelling biography, President Nixon&#39;s former White House counsel illuminates another presidency marked by scandal.</p><p><b>John Dean</b> served as Richard Nixon's White House lawyer for a thousand days. He received a graduate fellowship from American University to study government and the presidency, before entering Georgetown University Law Center, where he received his J.D. in 1965.

He lives in Beverly Hills, California with his wife Maureen. <br>&nbsp; <b>1</b><b>Young Harding</b>Warren Harding&#x2019;s life began as the Civil War was ending. In the winter of 1864, George Tyron Harding, a Union solider&#x2014;a fifer who had once shaken President Lincoln&#x2019;s hand at the White House&#x2014;was sent home to the Harding family farm near Blooming Grove, Ohio, and his new wife, Phoebe Elizabeth Dickerson, to recover from jaundice. The war was over before Tyron could return to his troops, and much to Phoebe&#x2019;s relief, for she was carrying their first son, who arrived on November 2, 1865. Phoebe wanted to name him Winfield but her husband preferred a family name: Warren Gamaliel. Warren was Tyron&#x2019;s grandmother&#x2019;s maiden name, and Gamaliel an uncle&#x2019;s name that would prove to be prophetic. In the Bible, Gamaliel was noted for counseling moderation and calmness.Warren was the eldest of eight children with two dying during childhood. The Harding family, closely knit and loving, was described by one observer as &#x201c;a splendid state of harmony.&#x201d; While Winnie was still a baby, Tyron and Phoebe moved to their own small house also located on the Harding family farm property. By age four Harding was reading. Phoebe instructed her son using printed letters and word cards from her Sunday school class. Harding&#x2019;s precociousness was striking: &#x201c;A born talker, the boy was encouraged to enter his first oratorical contest at age four. A year later, when he heard bells toll, he piped up, &#x2018;They&#x2019;re ringing for [George] Washington. Some day they will ring for me.&#x2019; Phoebe repeatedly predicted that he would become President.&#x201d;1 The child also had his father&#x2019;s musical ear and talent, which could be heard by all the neighboring farmers when he was given a cornet at age nine.Tyron and Phoebe Harding wanted more for themselves and their children than life on a farm. Both studied and practiced homeopathic medicine. Tyron started reading medicine in the office of a local doctor while his son was an infant. Medical education at the time was commenced by studying with a local physician for about three years before going to medical school.2 After completing his medical training Harding&#x2019;s father both farmed and practiced medicine until the family moved to the small rural town of Caledonia, where Dr. Harding developed his medical practice. Phoebe, who commenced her studies a few years after her husband, developed an active rural and town practice as a midwife. Throughout his early years, as the eldest boy, Harding worked on the farm, an experience from which he drew understanding for this difficult business, and later, as president, he recognized their special problems.Dr. Harding was frequently paid by his patients with livestock, farm tools, or land. As a result he became an active trader and an inveterate (although not highly successful) investor. By 1876 the father of a future president had acquired an ownership interest in a local newspaper, the <i>Caledonia Argus.</i> This investment profoundly influenced his son&#x2019;s life. At the <i>Argus,</i> as an eleven-year-old boy, young Harding was introduced to the newspaper business when his father apprenticed him as a part-time printer&#x2019;s devil. Given the boy&#x2019;s facility with words, he quickly learned to set type. After assisting the <i>Argus</i> editor to prepare a difficult outside printing job, needed overnight by a local lawyer, Warren was rewarded with a printer&#x2019;s ruler&#x2014;a 13-em makeup ruler&#x2014;once known in the craft as the tool of a full-fledged printer. It became a prized possession and his good luck charm, which he kept with him the rest of his life.3Formal education for all the Harding children started in Caledonia&#x2019;s one-room schoolhouse, where they studied reading, writing, spelling, mathematics, history, and geography. A standard text of the day was the McGuffey&#x2019;s <i>Readers</i>, described appropriately as &#x201c;firmly didactic little books that formed the moralistic attitudes of generations of Americans.&#x201d;4 McGuffey&#x2019;s <i>Readers</i> (there are seven of them) introduced the Harding children to important writers and thinkers, including Harding&#x2019;s first heroes, Napoleon Bonaparte and Alexander Hamilton, with Hamilton later becoming a frequent and favorite subject of Harding&#x2019;s Chautauqua circuit speeches.School was not a great challenge for young Harding. His father told an interviewer during his son&#x2019;s 1920 campaign for the White House, &#x201c;He studied his lessons, I don&#x2019;t know when. I never caught him at it and it used to worry me, so I asked his teacher what Warren was doing to bring in such decent reports when he didn&#x2019;t seem to work. &#x2018;Oh, he&#x2019;s just naturally smart,&#x2019; his teacher said.&#x201d;5 Jack Warwick, a schoolmate and friend of Harding&#x2019;s, confirms the ease with which he went through his schoolwork.At fourteen years of age, in the fall of 1879, Warren entered Ohio Central College (no longer in existence), located in Iberia, Ohio. The teenager was a gangling but strong fellow, already six feet tall, with an olive complexion, blue eyes, and wavy black hair. He worked his way through college by painting houses and barns, and, during the summers, doing heavy construction work on railroad gradings. In fact, his sister Charity later claimed that Warren had worked too hard: &#x201c;During vacation days he helped neighbors thrash their grain and worked with all the men, and did as much as anyone, but he was only fourteen years old. He plowed and looked after much of the orchard work at this time on our farm. He helped with the construction work on the Ohio Central Railroad ... . He worked hard every day, in fact too hard for one so young. I have often thought, and so did he, after he was older, that such heavy work (when so young and developing so rapidly) was not conducive to a strong physical foundation for after life.&#x201d;6As a college student Harding most enjoyed his courses in literature and philosophy. Frank Harris, his college roommate, remembered he loved reading &#x201c;the masters of English prose.&#x201d; Other subjects were easily ignored until the last minute for Harding was good at cramming. Harris says his roommate would &#x201c;sit down with his face to the wall, head in hands and soak [a subject] up. Then when he was through, he would jump up with a yell and shout, &#x2018;Now, darn it, I&#x2019;ve got you,&#x2019; and slam the book against the wall.&#x201d;7 Foreshadowing his business career, Harding and Harris launched a college newspaper their last year at Ohio Central College, calling it the <i>Iberia Spectator</i>, addressing it to the entire town of Iberia. Francis Russell, a Harding biographer often critical of his subject, praises the <i>Iberia Spectator:</i> &#x201c;For the two young editors the little four-page journal was a creditable production, as lively as many a county paper, full of local items and jokes and advertisements, its editorials ranging over such varied topics as the anti-polygamy bill [in the U.S. Congress] and the aurora borealis. It was a popular venture. &#x2018;The <i>Spectator,</i>&#x2019; Harding noted editorially, &#x2018;is taken by every family in our city excepting a few stingy old grumblers who take no more interest in home enterprise than a mule takes in a hive of bees.&#x2019;&#x201d;8According to Harris, his handsome roommate knew every pretty girl within five miles of the college, and they &#x201c;frolicked together as innocently as young pups.&#x201d; Warren&#x2019;s mother, not to mention his sisters, had instructed him well on the ways and wiles of women. Warren enjoyed the company of women and they liked this tall, dark, and handsome man who talked and thought so dearly of his mother. Harding visited his mother every Sunday to bring her a bouquet of flowers. When he was later too far away to visit he arranged to have flowers delivered, a practice that continued throughout her lifetime. Childhood friend and later a Federal Reserve Board governor David R. Crissinger recalled the influence Harding&#x2019;s mother had on her son. &#x201c;The affection between them was one of the most beautiful things in Mr. Harding&#x2019;s career. She was an extremely religious soul, and the strong religious and ethical feeling which is so evident in all that President Harding wrote was inherited from her.&#x201d;9During his last year at college Harding&#x2019;s family moved to Marion, Ohio, which was about six miles from Caledonia. Upon his graduation in 1882, at seventeen years of age, he joined his family in Marion. With a population of 4,000, it was a true &#x201c;city&#x201d; for the young country lad with its roller-skating rink, pool hall, taverns, and even a couple of brothels. The town, which was served by three railroads, was booming and Dr. Harding&#x2019;s practice quickly flourished; he was soon earning $500 a month (equivalent to about $8,600 per month today), enabling the purchase of &#x201c;a fine house&#x201d; in the center of town. 10When Warren joined his family in Marion he needed a job, not to mention a career. He had no idea what to do with his life. He later explained, &#x201c;I did what was very much in practice at the time&#x2014;turned to teaching, in my abundant fullness of knowledge, having just come out of college.&#x201d;11 He taught grade-school pupils at a one-room schoolhouse just north of Marion for one term. As he told his aunt in a February 12, 1883, letter, teaching was not going to be his profession: &#x201c;Next Friday, one week, ... forever my career as a pedagogue will close, and&#x2014;oh, the joy! I believe my calling to be in some other sphere and will follow out the belief. I sincerely hope that my Winter&#x2019;s labors are not lost but that those with whom I labored are somewhat benefited. How often it is that one&#x2019;s most arduous toils are without appreciation! I will never teach again without better (a good deal, too) wages, and an advanced school.&#x201d;12</p><h2>Jacques Pepin&#39;s Kitchen: Cooking With Claudine</h2><p>The master chef instructs his daughter in simple, elegant meals and cooking techniques that compliment both her graduate student budget and busy lifestyle with recipes for special occasions, lean feasts, and Pepin family favorites</p><p></p><h2>The Roman Republic</h2><p>The history of a small, semicivilized tribe who rose from obscurity and in 500 years created the greatest and most peaceful empire in the Western world</p><p></p><h2>Mangrove Squeeze</h2><p>A new mystery/thriller by the author of "Tropical Depression" and "Virgin Heat".

Widely considered modern America's most important philosopher, Dewey made his views known both through his writings and through such controversial episodes as his leadership of educational reform at the turn of the century; his support of American intervention in World War I and his leading role in the Outlawry of War movement after the war; and his participation in both radical and anti-communist politics in the 1930s and 40s. Robert B. Westbrook reconstructs the evolution of Dewey's thought and practice in this masterful intellectual biography, combining readings of his major works with an engaging account of key chapters in his activism. Westbrook pays particular attention to the impact upon Dewey of conversations and debates with contemporaries from William James and Reinhold Niebuhr to Jane Addams and Leon Trotsky. Countering prevailing interpretations of Dewey's contribution to the ideology of American liberalism, he discovers a more unorthodox Dewey&#x2015;a deviant within the liberal community who was steadily radicalized by his profound faith in participatory democracy. Anyone concerned with the nature of democracy and the future of liberalism in America&#x2015;including educators, moral and social philosophers, social scientists, political theorists, and intellectual and cultural historians&#x2015;will find <i>John Dewey and American Democracy</i> indispensable reading.</p></p><p>&#39;Far and away the best book on (Dewey) yet. Westbrook&#39;s intellectual biography...is scholarship at its finest--a very unusual combination of vast learning, dialectical acuity and literary skill....This book will do a great deal to make Dewey more available and plausible, and to help his writings shape the imagination of a new generation of Americans.&#39;--Richard Rorty, New Leader<p>Robert B.

And from Mexico, a monster has sent his foot soldiers to seize Shea&#x2013;using a weapon beyond anyone&#x2019;s worst nightmare.</p><p>Christy Reece is the author of<b> Rescue Me</b>. She holds a BSW from the University of Memphis and is a member of Romance Writers of America and International Thriller Writers. Christy Reece lives in Alabama with her husband, two adorable canines, and one very shy turtle. <b>Return to Me</b> is her second novel in a three-book series.<i>Chapter One<br>Three Months Later<br><br>Last Chance Rescue Headquarters</i><br><br>Paris, France<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure it&#x2019;s her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. She doesn&#x2019;t even bother to disguise her appearance.&#x201d;<br><br>Noah McCall shot from his chair and faced the window behind his desk. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe she&#x2019;d betray LCR. Nothing in her profile indicated this thread of evil inside her.&#x201d;<br><br>Gabriel Maddox stayed seated as he watched the head of LCR flounder for an answer. Seeing Noah show emotion no longer surprised him, but the changes in his boss were still fascinating. Before McCall met and married his wife, Samara, Gabe would have sworn nothing other than God himself could have forced an honest emotion from the man. But in the months since he&#x2019;d been married, Noah had done a complete about-face. Oh, he could still be a coldhearted bastard and no one dared cross him, but Gabe had heard him laugh on more than one occasion, and last month, when he announced that Samara was pregnant, damned if the man hadn&#x2019;t blushed.<br><br>&#x201c;How many abductions has she been involved in?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re sure of two,&#x201d; Gabe said.<br><br>&#x201c;I could have sworn she was about the straightest arrow LCR ever hired.&#x201d;<br><br>Not a patient man by nature, Gabe knew better than to rush his boss in making a decision. Especially as hard as this one would likely be. Didn&#x2019;t take a genius to know that the former LCR operative known as Shea Monroe would have to be dealt with, possibly taken out.<br><br>This decision wouldn&#x2019;t be easy for McCall. He&#x2019;d hired and trained every LCR operative since its beginning. Some of the younger ones called him Pop behind his back, though it was always said with an enormous amount of respect and even affection. Noah McCall had saved every one of their worthless hides and turned them into something. They might sometimes resent the tough restrictions he placed on them, but not one of them would speak against him.<br><br>Still, when an LCR operative went rogue, it affected everyone. Taking Shea down wouldn&#x2019;t be enjoyable but might well be necessary.<br><br>McCall dropped back into his chair. &#x201c;Anyone talked to Ethan lately?&#x201d;<br><br>It sounded like a casual question. Gabe knew different. Noah McCall didn&#x2019;t ask casual questions. Ethan Bishop had left LCR under a dark cloud. Few people knew the full reason for his dismissal, but speculation that he&#x2019;d become a loose cannon was the number one theory. Gabe knew this speculation was correct.<br><br>&#x201c;I talked to him a few months back,&#x201d; Gabe said.<br><br>&#x201c;So he doesn&#x2019;t know about Shea?&#x201d;<br><br>Gabe felt a slight nudge of guilt. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t see the need to tell him. When she went missing, we assumed she disappeared on purpose. Since Cole&#x2019;s death, Shea&#x2019;s not been at her best. Telling Ethan wouldn&#x2019;t have accomplished anything other than making him feel more like shit than he already does.&#x201d;<br><br>Noah turned his dark eyes on him and Gabe suddenly felt like an insect about to be skewered.<br><br>&#x201c;And now that we know she&#x2019;s working for the organization that killed her husband, you don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s something he&#x2019;d be interested in learning?&#x201d;<br><br>The answer Gabe gave was so lame, he inwardly winced as he said it. &#x201c;Ethan doesn&#x2019;t work for LCR any longer.&#x201d;<br><br>McCall continued that black-eyed stare. &#x201c;You want me to tell him?&#x201d; His voice had softened, which meant only one thing&#x2014;he was about to lose his temper.<br><br>Drawing a deep breath, Gabe gave the answer he didn&#x2019;t want to give. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;ll tell him.&#x201d; He shot his boss a narrow-eyed glare. &#x201c;You know he&#x2019;ll go after her, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because despite the evidence, I think Shea&#x2019;s worth saving. There&#x2019;s no one in the world better able to see Shea for what she is. If she&#x2019;s turned, Ethan&#x2019;ll know what he has to do. If she&#x2019;s in trouble, he&#x2019;ll bring her home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And if she&#x2019;s turned, she might just end up killing him.&#x201d;<br><br>An odd light flickered in McCall&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;Or she might end up saving them both.&#x201d;<br><br>Gabe stood, knowing his boss wouldn&#x2019;t change his mind, no matter what objections he gave. Noah McCall was of the opinion that almost everyone had something good in them. Since he&#x2019;d turned around a lot of lives, Gabe wasn&#x2019;t going to argue with him. But he&#x2019;d seen what Shea had done to his friend. Loving a woman that much was damned dangerous. Shea had taken advantage of that love, and Ethan would never be the same man again.<br><br>Gabe stalked out the door. Bypassing the elevator, he stomped down ten floors. Ethan didn&#x2019;t even own a phone. The only way to reach him was to fly there. His gut plummeted. Few people knew about his problem with enclosed places . . . the fewer, the better. By the time he made it to the podunk town in the Tennessee hills where Ethan had buried himself, Gabe would be in a lousy mood. Ethan wouldn&#x2019;t be happy to see him and would most likely try to throw him off his property.<br><br>On the other hand, a good fight never hurt anyone. His mood lightened. Damned if he wasn&#x2019;t suddenly looking forward to the trip after all.<br><br>East Tennessee<br><br>The sun blasted a welcome searing heat. Sweat poured off Ethan, splattering and dimpling the dirt like slow, fat raindrops. Wiping his hand across his brow, eyes squinted against the brightness, he gazed around at the progress he&#x2019;d made. After months of doing nothing but chopping down dead trees and clearing brush, he was beginning to see a small amount of progress. Yes, it would have been simpler to hire people to do this but not nearly as satisfying. This was his land. No one would care about this property as much as he did. It was his blood and sweat that would create something out of nothing. Besides, what the hell else did he have to do?<br><br>After throwing another tree limb onto the already full truck bed, Ethan jumped into the cab and started it up. One last load&#x2014;then he&#x2019;d shower and head to town for supplies. Once a month, he forced himself into town. He&#x2019;d already put it off three days longer than he should have. Out of coffee for the last day and a half, he felt like a rabid dog, on top of having a hell of a headache. The fast-food place a few miles from town would be his first stop. A giant cup of their strong brew would ease the pain. Hopefully, by the time he made it to the store he wouldn&#x2019;t want to kill anyone.<br><br>Under the rumble of timber slamming to the ground, he heard the quiet purr of an expensive car headed up his hill. Mercedes, maybe? Not a Jag. Whoever it was, they were lost. He was the only one who lived on this road.<br><br>He clenched his jaw, hating that he&#x2019;d have to see another person on his property, even for the short amount of time it would take to get them off. His fingers combed through a week&#x2019;s worth of growth on his face, pushed through his shoulder-length hair, soaked with sweat. Nice thing about looking like a serial killer&#x2014;most people who saw him turned around and ran the other way. Whoever was headed this way would soon do the same.<br><br>A sleek silver Mercedes rounded a corner and hit the top of the hill. The sun&#x2019;s glare against the windshield couldn&#x2019;t disguise the identity of the dark-haired man behind the wheel.<br><br>&#x201c;Shit.&#x201d; The dull pounding in Ethan&#x2019;s head blasted toward jackhammer status. Gabe Maddox. Last time he&#x2019;d talked to Gabe, he&#x2019;d told him to go to hell. Looked as though he hadn&#x2019;t taken the advice. Figured . . . bastard was stubborn like that.<br><br>Ethan glowered at the other man, letting him know up front that he still didn&#x2019;t want him around. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t believe you were invited.&#x201d;<br><br>Unfolding his long body from the leather seat, Gabe flashed an arrogant grin that was so popular with the ladies and pissed most men off because of it. &#x201c;If I waited for an invitation, I&#x2019;d never see you again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the idea.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry . . . I&#x2019;m on orders.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Noah sent you?&#x201d; Now, that was a surprise. Last time he saw Noah McCall, the man had damned near choked him to death. Not that he hadn&#x2019;t deserved it, but he figured McCall would just as soon pretend that Ethan had never existed.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; Gabe jerked his head toward the house. &#x201c;Mind if we talk inside?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>His eyes searching the hills warily, Gabe shrugged and headed toward the log house without Ethan&#x2019;s consent. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t like being out in the open like this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Damned stupid, coming from a claustrophobic.&#x201d;<br><br>Gabe turned to glare at him but kept walking.<br><br>Ethan threw his gloves down and stalked past Gabe, into the house. His home was only a few months old, but his furniture was almost as ancient as the surrounding hills. His things served their purpose, and that was all he cared about.<br><br>He tugged open the refrigerator and pulled out two beers. Tossing a bottle to Gabe, Ethan leaned against the counter, unscrewed the cap, and took a long swallow.<br><br>Easing down into a rickety chair at the scarred, aged table, Gabe swallowed a mouthful of beer and gazed around. &#x201c;Nice place you got here, man.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks. I&#x2019;ll tell the decorator you said so. Now, what the hell do you want?&#x201d;<br><br>Gabe took another swig of beer, set the bottle on the table, and blew out a long sigh.<br><br>A strange tension zipped up Ethan&#x2019;s spine. &#x201c;Must be something major for you to take so long in answering.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Shea.&#x201d;<br><br>The words were quietly spoken, but the impact to his heart and mind were like bombs exploding. He turned toward the kitchen window, unwilling to allow his former friend to see the naked pain. &#x201c;She dead?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. If only it were that simple.&#x201d;<br><br>Ethan turned sharply and growled, &#x201c;What the hell does that mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s gone sour.&#x201d;<br><br>Ethan snorted his disbelief. &#x201c;Shea wouldn&#x2019;t turn south. I&#x2019;d believe you turned before her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gee, thanks for the vote of confidence.&#x201d; Gabe waited a beat, allowing Ethan to absorb his statement. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got positive intel.&#x201d;</p><h2>Walt and Skeezix 1933-1934: Volume 8 in a series</h2><p><p><b>The new volume of the Eisner-nominated series, designed and edited by Chris Ware</b></p><p>This new volume, <i>Walt and Skeezix 1933&#x2013;1934</i>, opens amid tough times, as the Depression grinds into its fourth year. Against this setting, a con artist sets up a storefront in town for Continental Corncob, a fictitious company established to dupe would-be investors. Somehow Walt Wallet and the Gasoline Alley gang are roped into the scheme, with the promise that they could earn steep returns if they purchase shares in the allegedly thriving company. </p><p>The lean economic climate motivates young Skeezix and his friends to find inventive ways to earn money, although not always with the intended results. For their first project, they create a local newspaper for the neighborhood kids but are forced to shut down after the corner printshop burns down. Later, they start an after-school delivery service on roller skates, but the new business folds after a rival undercuts their prices with a cheaper alternative. </p><p>Frank King was one of the pioneering masters of cartooning, and this ongoing series serves as a fascinating historical document of early- to mid-twentieth-century American life. Edited and designed by Chris Ware (<i>Building Stories, Monograph</i>) and featuring an introduction by the comics historian Jeet Heer (<i>The New Republic</i>), this new volume also includes never-before-seen photographs and rare archival documents from the private collection of the King family.</p></p><p><p>One of the pioneering giants of American comic strips, <b>Frank King</b> was born in Cashton, Wisconsin, in 1883. He joined the staff of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> in 1909. Almost from the start of his career, King&#x2019;s cartoons were frequently featured on the front page of the paper. He made his lasting mark in 1919 by creating <i>Gasoline Alley</i>, which became one of the most widely syndicated and read strips in North America until King&#x2019;s death in 1969.</p><p>Cartoonist/designer <b>Chris Ware</b> is the author of <i>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</i>, <i>Quimby the Mouse</i>, and the <i>ACME Novelty Datebook</i>.

Rousseau goes on to lay forth the principles that he deems most important for achieving political right amongst people. Contained within this volume are also two discourses by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In &#34;A Discourse on the Origin of Inequality&#34; Rousseau examines the causes of the inequalities that exist among men concluding that it is the natural result of the formation of any civilization. In &#34;A Discourse on Political Economy&#34; Rousseau examines the nature of politics and their effect on people. These three works lay a solid foundation for the political philosophy of Rousseau and are a must read for any student of political science or philosophy.</p><p></p><h2>Tall Tales and Half Truths of Billy the Kid (American Legends)</h2><p>While many respectable books on Billy the Kid aim to demystify his illusory life, this one-of-a-kind collection proudly has no such intention. Find all of the untold and potentially true--but very unlikely and highly embellished--stories of the Kid&#39;s life, death and enthralling life thereafter. Be thrilled by sightings of Billy&#39;s ghost riding through old Fort Sumner and marvel at his search for the fabled Lost Adams Diggings. Wonder at the mysterious thefts of his tombstone and discover the famed desperado&#39;s dozen or so doppelgangers who posthumously popped up all across the Southwest. Courtesy of yarn-spinning raconteurs of yore, author John LeMay unveils the many forgotten and discarded tales of the legendary William H. Bonney, an everlasting emblem of the American West.</p><p>One of my all time favorites to write and research. When I was asked to do a book on Billy the Kid my first thought was, &#34;But there are already so many!&#34; I immediately thought it would be interesting to begin researching all of the most far-out Billy the Kid stories...the ones that couldn&#39;t possibly be true. And since most books search for the truth on the Kid, I thought why not do one that did the exact opposite and dig into the biggest Kid myths and legends? Granted, a few of these stories could be true..heck, some of them probably are. In any case, this truly is one of my favorite books that I&#39;ve ever written, and it also lead to an even greater &#34;sequel.&#34;John LeMay is a lifelong Roswell native and past president of the historical society for Southeast New Mexico.

Available for the first time in the West, this book tells the dramatic, action-packed story of the World War II forerunners of those spetsnaz - the naval ground reconnaissance detachments - as they led the Soviet advance through the Crimea with the Black Sea Fleet and through southeastern Europe with the Danube Flotilla.<br>Readers follow the expert swimmers, parachutists, skiers, mountain climbers, marksmen, and hand-to-hand combat specialists on one impossible mission after another, working behind German lines to gather intelligence and conduct partisan and diversionary-demolition operations. With prices on their heads, and hounded by ever growing numbers of German SS troops, the commandos lived by their wits and off the land, fighting their way out of every dangerous situation, blowing up bridges and fortifications, ambushing German patrols, snatching prisoners, and reporting enemy strengths. Commandos from the Sea reads like the best action/adventure fiction.<br>Based on interviews and archival research, this unique contribution to the history of special operations is a moving human drama of unorthodox characters who volunteer for suicide missions out of love for country, each other, and their commander, Senior Lieutenant Viktor Kalganov - known as "The Beard." Mr. Strekhnin's is the only account in English that details this little-known special warfare unit.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Toilet: How It Works</h2><p><p>Celebrated author-illustrator and master explainer David Macaulay brings his unique voice and style to high-interest nonfiction books for newly independent readers. <br>Everyone knows what a toilet is for, right? But what exactly happens after you flush? Where does our waste go, and how is it made safe? With his unique blend of informative text and illustration, David Macaulay takes readers on a tour of the bathroom, plumbing, and the sewer system, from the familiar family toilet to the mysterious municipal water treatment plant. <br>A <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> Best Book of 2013</p></p><p><p><b>David Macaulay</b> received his bachelor of architecture degree from Rhode Island School of Design. In January 1973, Macaulay went to France to work on the first of his twenty-five books, <i>Cathedral</i>. He then constructed a colonial Roman town (<i>City</i>, 1974), erected monuments to the Pharaohs (<i>Pyramid</i>, 1975), dissected the maze of subterranean systems below and essential to every major city (<i>Underground</i>, 1976), built a medieval fortress (<i>Castle</i>, 1977), and dismantled the Empire State Building (<i>Unbuilding</i>, 1980). Macaulay is perhaps best known for <i>The Way Things Work</i> (1988). It was followed by <i>Black and White</i> (1990) for which he won the 1991 Caldecott Medal.

Probably&#x2014;it&#x2019;s rather magical how everything just disappears, isn&#x2019;t it? In his signature squiggly style, Macaulay pulls back the curtain to show just how it all goes down (so to speak). Whether it&#x2019;s the family dog&#x2019;s bone, a dead goldfish, or human waste, the toilet makes it disappear. &#x201c;Clever toilet.&#x201d; The main event here is the authors&#x2019; annotated cutaways of toilets, showing how the handle pulls the stopper and so forth. Despite the easily understandable text, some concepts remain a bit elusive, though things get clearer and even more interesting when we move on to rural septic tanks, big-city sewer systems, and wastewaster treatment plants. Boldfaced vocabulary words would&#x2019;ve helped readers refer to the closing glossary (though some intriguing words, like scum and digester, aren&#x2019;t defined). While not as successful as Castle: How It Works (2012), this is high-interest stuff done in a just-humorous-enough way. Pair with Elizabeth Raum&#x2019;s The Story behind Toilets (2009) for some extended bathroom reading.

Abducted near his home in Las Vegas, New Mexico, in October 1866, he became Many Bears's grandson, Andele. He quickly adapted to his new life, grew to manhood among the Kiowa, took part in Kiowa raiding parties when he turned sixteen, and three times married Kiowa women.</p><p>Confined to a reservation in Oklahoma after 1875, Andele in the 1880s sought to reclaim his former life and returned to his family in Las Vegas. But in 1889, feeling "his interests were all identified with the Kiowa, and that he had learned to love them," he returned to the reservation, taught industrial arts at the agency school, and aided the Kiowa in defense of their lands. In the 1890s Andele began serving as a resource to a generation of anthropologists studying Kiowa and Apache society. His captivity narrative, published in 1899 by the Methodist missionary J. J. Methvin, is an invaluable eyewitness description of Plains Indians. It is reissued with an introduction by ethnohistorian James F.

During this period, he surveyed over a hundred sites around Kabul, Jalalabad and Wardak, making numerous drawings of the sites, together with maps, compass readings, sections of the stupas and sketches of some of the finds. Small illustrations of a selection of these key sites were published in Ariana Antiqua in 1841. However, this represents only a tiny proportion of his official and private correspondence held in the India Office Collection of the British Library which is studied in detail for the first time in this publication. It is supplemented online by The Charles Masson Archive: British Library and British Museum Documents relating to the Masson Collection (British Museum Research Publication number 216). Together they provide the means for a comprehensive reconstitution of the archaeological record of the sites. In return for funding his exploration of the ancient sites of Afghanistan, the British East India Company received all of Masson&#x2019;s finds. These were sent to the India Museum in London, and when it closed in 1878 the British Museum was the principal recipient of all the &#x2018;archaeological&#x2019; artifacts and a proportion of the coins. This volume therefore studies the British Museum&#x2019;s collection of these fascinating objects, including reliquaries, beads and coins, and places them within a wider historical and archaeological context.</p><p>Elizabeth Errington first began working on the archaeological records of Charles Masson during research for her doctoral thesis on the 19th-century discovery of the Buddhist sites of Gandhara. She was a curator of South and Central Asian coins in the British Museum (1993&#x2013;2011) and from 1993 onwards has served as the co-ordinator and principal researcher for the British Museum&#x2019;s Masson Project.</p><h2>An Unofficial Rose</h2><p>Widower Hugh Peronett becomes disturbed when he discovers that his married son is having an affair with his own former girlfriend</p><p>Iris Murdoch's 24th novel, a San Francisco Chronicle bestseller, explores the meaning of life in a story of love and betrayal, faith and doubt. <p>"Murdoch works with an intellectual daring most writers only dream of." - The Philadelphia Inquirer</p>From the elderly widower, Hugh, to his granddaughter, Miranda, the nine characters in this novel are all looking for love; and so closely is the web woven that the actions and passions of each are constantly affecting the others.</p><h2>Little House on the Prairie Book and Charm (Charming Classics)</h2><p><p><b> LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE</b></p><p> Meet Laura Ingalls, the little girl who would grow up to write the Little House books.</p><p> Pa Ingalls decides to sell the little log house, and the family sets out for Indian country! They travel from Wisconsin to Kansas, and there, finally, Pa builds their little house on the prairie. Sometimes farm life is difficult, even dangerous, but Laura and her family are kept busy and are happy with the promise of their new life on the prairie.</p><p> Ages 8&#x2013;12</p><p> </p></p><p><p>The adventures continue for Laura Ingalls and her family as they leave their little house in the Big Woods of Wisconsin and set out for Kansas. They travel for many days in their covered wagon until they find the best spot to build their little house on the prairie. Soon they are planting and plowing, hunting wild ducks and turkeys, and gathering grass for their cows. Sometimes pioneer life is hard, but Laura and her folks are always busy and happy in their new little house.</p><p>Laura Ingalls Wilder was born in 1867 in the log cabin described in <i>Little House in the Big Woods</i>. She and her family traveled by covered wagon across the Midwest. Later, Laura and her husband, Almanzo Wilder, made their own covered-wagon trip with their daughter, Rose, to Mansfield, Missouri. There, believing in the importance of knowing where you began in order to appreciate how far you've come, Laura wrote about her childhood growing up on the American frontier. For millions of readers Laura lives on forever as the little pioneer girl in the beloved Little House books.</p></p><h2>CHRISTMAS WITH ANGELINA (Angelina Ballerina)</h2><p>Angelina, the little mouse, and her baby brother get ready for the Christmas holidays, shopping for gifts, decorating the tree, and meeting Father Christmas.</p><p></p><h2>Against the Current</h2><p>The eminent British historian-philosopher writes of those thinkers--Machiavelli, Vico, Montesquieu, Herzen, and Hume--whose plurality, diversity, or antidogmatism he most admires.</p><p><br> <p>'This is an exceptional volume by a remarkable intellectual.

Known for his hilarious, uninhibited honesty and his smooth-talking way with the ladies, Pepe has finally written the book everyone has been begging him to publish.

Take Back Your Life explains the seductive draw that leads people into such situations, provides guidelines for assessing what happened, and hands-on tools for getting back on track. Written for victims, their families, and professionals, this book leads readers through the healing process.</p><p>Janja Lalich, Ph.D., is Associate Professor of Sociology at California State University, Chico. She has been studying the cult phenomenon since the late 1980s and has coordinated local support groups for ex-cult members and for women who were sexually abused in a cult or abusive relationship. She is the author of Bounded Choice: True Believers and Charismatic Cults, and co-author, with Margaret Singer, of Cults in Our Midst. <p>Madeleine Tobias, M.S., R.N., C.S., is the Clinical Coordinator and a psychotherapist at the Vet Center in White River Junction, Vermont, where she treats veterans who experienced combat and/or sexual trauma while in the military. Previously she had a private practice in Connecticut and was an exit counselor helping ex-members of cultic groups and relationships.</p>Tobias and Lalich spent a combined total of 24 years in "restrictive groups" (i.e., cults), and both are currently involved in providing post-cult counseling and therapy. Their first collaboration, this book succeeds as an ambitious, comprehensive explanation of the cult experience and works well on several levels. Its stated focal intent is to encourage and assist those former cultists struggling to readjust to the "real world." Powered by the authors' experience, compassion, and intellect, it capably provides such support. In addition, however, Tobias and Lalich's systematic analysis of the shared characteristics of cults and cult leaders, along with extensive first-person accounts by former cultists, will educate those readers with a purely intellectual interest in the allure, power, and structure of cults.

With the techniques revealed in this classic book, you can learn how to make your game work from tee to green, step-by-step and stroke by stroke. </p><p> In each chapter, a different tested fundamental is explained and demonstrated with clear illustrations -- as though Hogan were giving you a personal lesson with the same skill and precision that made him a legend. Whether you're a novice player or an experienced pro, <i>Ben Hogan's Five Lessons</i> is a must-have reference for anyone who knows that fundamentals are where champions begin.</p></p><p>Ben Hogan&#39;s premise in this 1957 classic is driven home in bold letters: &#34;THE AVERAGE GOLFER IS ENTIRELY CAPABLE OF BUILDING A REPEATING SWING AND BREAKING 80.&#34; Religions are founded on less, and Hogan&#39;s detailed analyses and illustrated demonstrations of grip, stance, posture, and the two basic components of the swing make up a sacred book. Though its very simplicity seems dated, this is the tome of technique that should serve as the foundation of every golf library.<b>Ben Hogan</b> discovered golf as a fifteen-year-old caddie. He turned pro at seventeen, joined the tour full-time as a nineteen-year-old in 1931, and has won nine pro majors. A four-time PGA Player of the Year, he is one of only four golfers to win all four professional majors. At forty-one, he won five of six tournaments, including the Masters, U.S. Open and the British Open. Hogan died at eighty-four&nbsp;in 1997 in his home in Fort Worth.</p><h2>The Jews of Ireland: From Earliest Times to the Year 1910</h2><p>Physical description; xix, 403 pages, xx pages of plates : illustrations (black and white) ; 23 cm.

Joinmed by their families and about a dozen other individuals, the Con-Sociate family (as they called themselves) was to bring about a new Eden by cultivating a mystical and scetic way of life in a rural retreat. Compiling, in their own words, from letters, diaries, and books, and from the comments of friends and associates such as Emerson and Thoreau, Clara Endicott Sears, founder of Fruitlands Museum, tells the story of this famous encounter of transcendental philosophy with the realities of the New England soil and climate and the vagaries of human nature. Louisa May Alcott&#39;s classic satire based on her father&#39;s experiment, &#34;&#34;Transcendental Wild Oats,&#34;&#34; completes the picture of a noble failure.</p><p><p>Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888) is the author of the beloved Little Women, which was based on her own experiences growing up in New England with her parents and three sisters.

It contains, in addition, reflection upon the various kinds of knowledge, an extended treatment of definition, and a lengthy analysis of the nature and causes of doubt. The characteristic of the work is the discussion of different form of perception at Chapter IV and illustration of the best one in relation with the experience and intelligence at the next Chapter. He also addresses the issues of memory and forgetting. Spinoza commenced this treatise with the intention of examining the problem of knowledge, but the work was never completed. In his other works epistemological discussions are intimately linked with the rest of his philosophy. Indeed, even in the Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding epistemological views are almost inseparably connected with ethical ones. That is the consequence of his characteristic conception of knowledge. For Spinoza "knowledge" is "life", not in the sense that contemplation is the highest life, but in the sense that knowledge is the means of holding together the threads of life in a systematic unity that can fill its proper place in the cosmic system. There are two things which must be borne in mind in connection with Spinoza's conception of knowledge. The first is his insistence on the active character of knowledge. The ideas or concepts by means of which thought construes reality are not like "lifeless pictures on a panel"; they are activities by which reality is apprehended; they are part of reality, and reality is activity. The second point is that Spinoza does not divorce knowing from willing. Man always acts according to his lights. If a man's endeavours appear to fall short of his knowledge, that is only because his knowledge is not really what it is held to be, but is wanting in some respect. On the one hand, reason, for Spinoza, is essentially the "practical reason". On the other hand, the highest expression of willing is experienced in that striving for consistency and harmony which is so characteristic of reason.</p><p>Baruch Spinoza (1632 &#x2013; 1677, later Benedict de Spinoza) was a Dutch philosopher. The breadth and importance of Spinoza's work was not fully realized until years after his death. By laying the groundwork for the 18th century Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism, including modern conceptions of the self and, arguably, the universe, he came to be considered one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy.</p><h2>Elephants Don&#39;t Sit on Cars (Piccolo Books)</h2><p>Twelve short episodes make up this story collection.

Politicians such as Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan promoted Smith's famous 1776 book, <i>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</i>, as the bible of laissez- faire economics. In this vigorous, crisp, and accessible book, James Buchan refutes much of what modern politicians and economists claim about Adam Smith and shows that, in fact, Smith transcends modern political categories.<br><br>Drawing on twenty-five years of research, Buchan demonstrates that <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> and Smith's 1759 masterpiece, <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>, are just brilliant fragments of one of the most ambitious philosophical enterprises ever attempted: the search for a just foundation for modern commercial society both in private and in public. In an increasingly crowded and discontented world, this search is ever more urgent.</p><p><b>James Buchan</b>, a leading novelist and historian, won the Duff Cooper Award for Frozen Desire. His most recent work is a study of Enlightenment Edinburgh, <i>Crowded with Genius</i>. He lives in Norfolk, England.In this thorough, encyclopedic study, Buchan goes beyond the modern myth of Adam Smith-father of the laissez-faire approach to free markets and champion of small government-to find a more nuanced view, one that supercedes the narrow views of contemporary disciples such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Taking the reader deep into Smith's works and beliefs, Buchan produces a thinker as often concerned with philosophy and aesthetics as with economics and finance, a man of immense gifts, nearly unlimited potential, and unrestrained drive who, although he achieved much, "meant to have done more." Smith died at 67 the author of perhaps the first great work of modern economics (The Wealth of Nations), but still hoping to complete treatises on the visual and performing arts and to revisit his first major book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Buchan clearly knows his subject, as his treatment is detailed and backed up with ample endnotes, and this volume will be of great interest to specialists or those with a strong background in Smith's work. However, the book takes a rather flat approach to its subject, moving evenly and predictably from beginning to end, without any effort at dramatic tension or narrative energy.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

To redress this inequity, Austerlitz presents more than 100 biographical sketches of top comedy talents from Charlie Chaplin to Judd Apatow, augmented by shorter tidbits regarding lesser players. So the Jim Carrey saga coexists with the legend of Harold Lloyd, and the debonair comic stylings of Cary Grant contrast nicely with those of Will Ferrell. As the title would indicate, Laurel and Hardy are limned, as are Buster Keaton, W. C. Fields, Mae West, and the Marx Brothers. Katharine Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, and Doris Day are the only other women accorded full chapters, but Myrna Loy, Carole Lombard, and Tina Fey, among others, garner tidbit status. More recent comic masters featured include Ben Stiller, the Coen Brothers, and Steve Martin. With broad coverage like this, the book has some reference applications, though most of the pieces are unfailingly upbeat. Even tragic death is fraught with dreamy potential: regarding Jean Harlow&#x2019;s death at 26, Austerlitz muses, &#x201c;What might Preston Sturges have made of her had she lived?&#x201d; Entertaining reading. --Mike Tribby</p><h2>The history of perfume in Venice</h2><p>Brand new, hardcover edition.</p><p></p><h2>Best Lesbian Erotica 2000</h2><p><p>The bestselling lesbian erotica series in America!</p><p>Capturing the hottest, freshest lesbian erotica of the year.</p><p>"For me, the best erotic stories closely resemble the people who make my skin flush hot pink and send my head into overdrive.

Yoga has been described as a system of health through physical and mental disciplines; as a system of physical and psychological rules of procedure; as the toning of the body through action and attitude. The Yogi Vithaldas himself says: &#34;Yoga lays stress on bodily and mental poise and produces an equanimity of spirit beneficial to the whole nervous system.&#34; In this book the Yogi Vithaldas outlines the benefits of Yoga for ordinary men and women and explains the system of exercises of which he himself is the teacher. These explanations, illustrated by photographs of the author, describe the movements so clearly that any normally active person can follow them. Through Yoga troubled people and those with uneasy nerves have achieved relaxation, ease of tension and clarity of mind as well as a continual feeling of physical well0being. For a thorough understanding of the system of Yoga and its application to individual needs, this is probably the simplest and most direct book that can be found.</p><p></p>
